" Georges Ibrahim Abdallah","","Apr 02, 1951","","","Georges is a Lebanese Arab struggler for Palestine, imprisonedin French prisons for over 32 years. Georges Abdallah's case has builtsignificant support in Lebanon and in France, and Palestinian prisonershave highlighted the importance of Abdallah's case as part of the struggleof the Palestinian political prisoners for freedom and liberation.Abdallah was sentenced to life imprisonment in France, accused ofparticipating in actions in France targeting U.S. and Israeli interestsduring the Israeli invasion and occupation of Lebanon. During his arrestand trial, one of his original lawyers was a spy against him, working forFrench intelligence. He has been eligible for release under parole since1999. He has been repeatedly refused, and at times when his release toLebanon has been approved by the French judiciary, the highest forces ofthe state, including then-Interior Minister Manuel Valls – with the clearinvolvement of the U.S. government, including the personal intervention ofHillary Clinton – have intervened to keep Georges Ibrahim Abdallah lockedup in French prison.Throughout his time in prison, Georges Ibrahim Abdallah has remainedpolitically active and, indeed, a leader, extending solidarity and fullsupport to struggling prisoners and peoples’ movements around the world. Heand fellow prisoners – Basque and Arab, among others – in Lannemezan prisonreturned their meals in solidarity with Palestinian hunger striker BilalKayed, and he has previously participated in hunger strikes in solidaritywith Palestinian individual and collective strikes for justice and freedom.He recently expressed his solidarity with Toulouse BDS activists underattack and has constantly remained an active thinker on Arab, Palestinianand international liberation struggles.He has always refused to in any way capitulate or renounce his politicalvision and commitment to the Palestinian cause, to the people of Lebanon,and to international struggles for liberation. He remains a committedanti-Zionist, anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist. In part because of thatvery refusal, he remains today imprisoned in the French prison ofLannemezan.The imprisonment of Georges Abdallah comes alongside the persecution andarrest of BDS activists in France for urging the boycott of Israel insolidarity with the Palestinian people, ongoing racist targeting of Araband Muslim communities in France and the ""state of emergency"" being used torepress popular movements for justice, while the French state promotesitself as a supporter of ""peace"" in the region while acting directly insupport of the Israeli occupation and Zionist colonization.","Yes","","CP de Lannemezan","France","","Mr.","Georges Ibrahim Abdallah 2388/A221","LANNEMEZAN","65307","BP 70166","","","204 rue des Saligues","Anti-Imperialist","","","","Imprisoned","","https://www.facebook.com/liberation.george.abdallah","https://twitter.com/@GeorgesABDALLA","Thursday, April 13, 2017 - 10:35"

"Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Kolchenko","","Nov 26, 1989","","Crimean 4","Only letters in Russian are accepted, so you can send postcards or use google translate in case you do not speak Russian. Aleksandr/Oleksandr Kolchenko was detained in Crimea on May 17, 2014, on suspicion of participation in a ""terrorist group,"" which planned explosions near the eternal fire memorial and the Lenin monument in Simferopol on May 8th and 9th, and of having sabotaged railway tracks and electricity lines. Kolchenko is also suspected of having carried out two arson attacks: against the headquarters of the Russian Unity-party and Russian Community of Crimea on April 14th, and the office of the United Russia party in Simferopol on April 18th. The case is run by the FSB, the former KGB. Aleksandr is an anarchist and antifascist who has participated in student and environmental actions. He has been part of campaigns against tuition fees and supported workers' rights protests. He was under constant Nazi attack for his antifascist ideas. One incident took place after a film screening about murdered anti-fascist journalist Anastasiya Baburova, where he was attacked by thirty Nazis using knives. In this context, claims by the Russian authorities that Aleksandr is part of the nationalist ""Right Sector"" are ridiculous, and he is denying these claims.Aleksandr is claimed to be part of a bigger group protesting against the Russian invasion of Crimea by organising direct actions. A famous film director, Oleg/Oleh Sentsov, as well as two Maydan activists, Gennadiy/Hennadiy Afanasyev and Alexei Chirniy, have also been detained under the same suspicion. All of them are claimed to be part of the Right Sector (a Ukrainian ultra-right organisation). This is a lie as apart from Chirniy none of the accused have any connection to the Right sector, and Aleksandr Kolchenko has never shared nationalist ideas. The whole case is considered to be part of the Russian campaign to take over Crimea, which includes repressions against anyone who doesn't comply with the new authority.Aleksandr and Oleg were sentenced by the North Caucasus Military District Court in Russia to 20 and 10 years imprisonment respectively. They were charged with preparing to blow up the Lenin monument in Simferopol (Crimea), and setting fire to offices belonging to the Russian Community of Crimea and the United Russia Party in occupied Crimea. The Russian human rights movement has recognized both men as political prisoners. Aleksandr is serving time in Kopeysk penal colony as a “person inclined to spread extremist ideology.” Hennadiy was sentenced to seven years but released on June 14, 2016 after it was exposed that his testimony against himself and Aleksandr and Oleg was forced and fabricated through torture.Donations via PayPal can be made to abc-msk@riseup.net or using a bank account (write to the same e-mail address for details).Media:Aleksandr's statement: Aleksandr Kolchenko: I am not a terrorist.

"Alexandros Mitrousias","","","","Halandri, Nea Smyrni","While he denies being a member of the Cells of Fire, Alexandros was tried in the so-called “Halandri case.” He was found guilty of manufacturing explosives, possessing explosives, and being an accomplice to the explosion at the home of PASOK ministers Louka Katseli and Gerasimos Arsenis. Sentenced to 11 years in prison out of a total combined sentence of 19 years, and chose not to submit an application for a suspended sentence.He is also facing charges in the “Nea Smyrni case” (on charges of forming an “unnamed terrorist organisation”). Here is a link to a statement.  On December 4, 2010 and the days that followed, a massive counterterrorism operation took place in and around the Athens metropolitan area. Among the six people (five men and one woman) later imprisoned were Giorgos Karagiannidis and Alexandros Mitrousias, both of whom had warrants out for their arrest since September 2009 on charges related to the Fire Cells Conspiracy case. Karagiannidis was arrested at an apartment in Piraeus. Mitrousias and another comrade, Constantinos Sakkas, were arrested as they were leaving a garage in the Nea Smyrni neighborhood. They allegedly had a bag in their possession containing two Glock pistols, a Skorpion submachine gun, and a hand grenade. In the garage, police also found three submachine guns, seven pistols of different manufacture, 50 kilograms of ANFO explosive, four hand grenades, three AK-47 assault rifles, a silencer, a large quantity of bullets, and 200 grams of TNT. At another location, were found more than 30 fake ID cards, as well as other “contraband.” Karagiannidis and Mitrousias both denied having any relationship to the Fire Cells Conspiracy. Their arrest warrants, as well as warrants for others, were issued at the end of September 2009 on the basis of fingerprints found at Hatzimichelakis’ home—the notorious “safe house” in the Halandri neighborhood, where everything began. Since all the weapons were clean, the authorities were unable to link the six people arrested on December 4—some of whom don’t know one another and were arrested in different places—to any specific attacks, so they are now talking about “a new terrorist organization.”Address is updated as of 12/04/13.","No","","Dikastiki Filaki A Pteryga","Greece","","Alexandros","Mitrousias","Athens","TK 18110","","","","Koridallos","Anarchist","","Korydallos Prison Korydallos","Saturday, December 4, 2021","Imprisoned","","","","Monday, April 24, 2017 - 15:43"

"Alvaro Luna Hernandez","","May 12, 1952","","","Alvaro Luna Hernandez is a Chicano-Mexicano political prisoner sentenced to 50 years in prison for aggravated assault on an officer when he disarmed a sheriff attempting to shoot him.Personal BackgroundHe was born in Alpine, Texas, in 1952, into a racially segregated society, where police ruled the Chicano barrio with an iron fist. On June 12, 1968, Alvaro was with 16 year old Ervay Ramos and witnessed Ramos murdered in cold-blood by Alpine Police Bud Powers, a known racist cop with a history of brutality against Chicanos. Powers never served a day in jail and escaped justice under the protection of the U.S. judicial system.Since that day in 1968, Alvaro worked tirelessly for Chicano rights and against police brutality.  As a result, he was also the constant target of police harassment and brutality.  In 1976 Alvaro was falsely accused of murder, for which he narrowly escaped the death penalty, destined instead to serve a life sentence.  After media highlighted Alvaro’s unfair trial and proof of his innocence, he was released. Later on he also suffered a beating at the hands of several police officers.  Two deputy sheriffs were convicted for the criminal civil rights violations stemming from the beating. The police received five years probation and never spent a day in jail.In the 1990s Alvaro worked as the national coordinator of the Ricardo Aldape Guerra Defense Committee, which led the successful struggle to free Mexican national Aldape Guerra from Texas’ death row after being framed by Houston police for allegedly killing a cop.  In 1993, Alvaro was a non-governmental organization (NGO) delegate before the 49th session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, Switzerland. Before the U.N. General Assembly, he vociferously exposed and condemned the U.S. government’s dismal human rights record and its human rights violations of U.S. political prisoners.Because of his work around police brutality and his active organizing in the barrios of Houston, the police began to monitor his activities.  In 1996 events would turn for the worse, landing Alvaro in prison, this time for 50 years.Legal CaseAlvaro Disarms OfficerOn July 18, 1996, Sheriff Jack McDaniel of Alpine, Texas, went to arrest Alvaro at his home on a charge of aggravated robbery (later dismissed with Alvaro as his own counsel). No warrant for the arrest was issued and when the unarmed Alvaro questioned the sheriff’s abuse of power, McDaniel became violently angry and drew his weapon. Before he could raise it and shoot, Alvaro disarmed him and fled to a nearby mountain.What followed next was the most massive police manhunt in recent West Texas history. In fear for his life, Alvaro eluded police helicopters, bloodhound tracking dogs from the nearby state prison in Ft. Stockton, armed vigilante groups searching for him, and other state and federal police agencies. Alvaro sought refuge in the mountainous country he knew well as a youth.Stand Off with the PoliceDays later, Alvaro returned to his mother’s house to eat and change clothes. The police found out and a heavily armed law enforcement contingent converged on the home. Without identifying themselves, police began shooting indiscriminately at the house, cars parked in front and at the public street lights. At trial, witnesses described the police shooting as a “war zone.” The police wanted Alvaro dead and were refusing to allow him to surrender.To back them off their murderous intent, Alvaro returned fire in self-defense but never shot nor injured anyone. He then dialed 911 (emergency) and alerted other officials that the police were shooting at him and would not allow him to surrender. The City Manager pulled the army of troopers back, and the “shoot first-ask questions later” plot to kill Alvaro was aborted. During the police barrage, Sgt. Curtis Hines was shot in the left hand by a ricocheting police bullet.Alvaro Arrested Alvaro surrendered and was charged with two counts of aggravated assault; one count for disarming the sheriff and one count for Sgt. Hines’ wound. His elderly mother was charged with “hindering apprehension” and jailed.The TrialAt his arraignment, Alvaro condemned the illegal occupation of the Southwest, the false charges, institutionalized racism, and reasserted his people’s inalienable rights to self-defense and to self-determination of oppressed nations. He invoked international law and demanded to be treated as a prisoner of war under Geneva Convention principles and other human rights accords.The initial charge which led to the July 18 confrontation with the police was later dismissed. Rejecting court-appointed attorneys as sellouts, Alvaro represented himself in court.At the Odessa trial, he was able to have the original charge of aggravated robbery dropped. In the end, Alvaro was convicted of “threatening” the sheriff, but acquitted on the charge of shooting Sgt. Hines in the hand.  The mostly-white jury explained that they would have “disgraced” the police and sent the “wrong message” to others that it is justified under law to defend oneself against the armed violence of the state. In a town where the police have ruled Raza barrios with an iron fist, and with someone such as Alvaro who the police admitted on the stand was a “troublemaker” and someone they all hated, many believe the climate in Texas pressured the jury to charge Alvaro with threatening a sheriff instead of acquitting him of that charge as well.  It also explains the extreme sentence of 50 years handed down by the judge.Video Evidence DeniedAfterward in a TV interview, the sheriff stated that Alvaro only disarmed him of his gun and never acted aggressive or in a threatening way.  The video clip, considered pivotal evidence, was to be subpoenaed in his 1997 trial, but the prosecution squelched its introduction and convinced the judge to block it, then forced the Sheriff to recant his off-the-record story in subsequent testimony.Life in PrisonIn prison, Alvaro was later accused by prison administrators of gang affiliations and transferred to X-Wing (investigative/administrative segregation) of the Beto Unit. Alvaro consistently denied gang affiliations and stated he was targeted because of his political views, and connections he made with fellow Mexicano captives. This segregation was part of a campaign of harassment by prison administrators that included, at one point, transferring Alvaro from laundry room to field labor work detail and threats from guards. He has now spent more than 10 years in the repressive “control unit” of the Texas prison.Since his jailing, Alvaro has filed several civil rights suits against county jail conditions, police abuse, and has helped other prisoners assert their legal and human rights.As of December 2009, the prison officials were also denying him library materials.MediaDownloads (brochures, stickers, stencils)Writings","Yes","Texas","James V Allred Unit","United States","","Alvaro","Luna Hernández #255735","Iowa Park","76367","","","","2101 FM 369 North","Chicano Liberation","https://jpay.com/FirstTime.aspx?Search=255735&State=TX","James V.

"Ana Belen Montes","","Feb 28, 1957","","","Ana Belen Montes was a Pentagon intelligence analyst who, opposed to the plans of aggression against Cuba being developed, felt morally obliged to alert the Cuban government of said plans. Her actions were uncovered and she was accused of high treason, a crime punishable by death. She was forced to negotiate with the prosecution and to plead guilty to espionage on behalf of Cuba. In 2002, she was sentenced to 25 years in prison, a sentence she has been serving under extreme and inhumane isolation:Ana may only receive letters and visits from 20 people (her father passed away before she was imprisoned).The fact 20 people / relatives may visit her does not mean everyone on this list exercises that right. Very few people have visited her over these past few years (perhaps only two or three in total), for reasons that include the remoteness of the facility and others.Ana may call her mother once a week and speak with her for 15-20 minutes.Currently, she may read books (sent from bookstores or publishers) and magazines. She may also watch documentaries and CNN.She maintains no relationships with anyone in the prison and is always alone in her cell, where she has been confined for nearly 15 years.Ana Belen Montes did not act on the basis of financial, political or ideological interests. She did what she did because her conscience dictated that she was doing something morally justified, and that the immoral, the wrong thing, were the الوليد plans of aggression against Cuba. She was accused of having helped convince both George W. Bush and Bill Clinton that Cuba did not represent a military threat to the U.S., thus preventing a war that would have resulted in a significant loss of Cuban and US lives.”Her motivations and sense of ethics are clearly revealed by her statements during her trial:“Your honor, I engaged in the activity that brought me before you because I obeyed my conscience rather than the law. I believe our government’s policy towards Cuba is cruel and unfair, profoundly unneighborly, and I felt morally obligated to help the island defend itself from our efforts to impose our values and our political system on it.“We have displayed intolerance and contempt towards Cuba for most of the last four decades. We have never respected Cuba’s right to make its own journey towards its own ideals of equality and justice. I do not understand why we must continue to dictate how the Cubans should select their leaders, who their leaders cannot be, and what laws are appropriate in their land. Why can’t we let Cuba pursue its own internal journey, as the United States has been doing for over two centuries?“My greatest desire is to see amicable relations emerge between the United States and Cuba. I hope my case in some way will encourage our government to abandon its hostility towards Cuba and to work with Havana in a spirit of tolerance, mutual respect, and understanding.“Today we see more clearly than ever that intolerance and hatred –by individuals or governments –spread only pain and suffering. I hope for a U.S. policy that is based instead on neighborly love, a policy that recognizes that Cuba, like any nation, wants to be treated with dignity and not with contempt.“Such a policy would bring our government back in harmony with the compassion and generosity of the American people. It would allow Cubans and Americans to learn from and share with each other. It would enable Cuba to drop its defensive measures and experiment more easily with changes. And it would permit the two neighbors to work together and with other nations to promote tolerance and cooperation in our one ‘world-country,’ in our only ‘world-homeland’”","Yes","Texas","FMC Carswell","United States","","Ana","Belen Montes #25037-016","Fort Worth","76127","","","","P.O.

"Anastasios ""Tasos"" Theofilou","","","","Fire Cells Conspiracy","Arrested on August 24, 2012 for a bank robbery committed days prior and charged with this as well as participation in a revolutionary organization.On February 7th, 2014 anarchist communist Tasos Theofilou was sentenced to 25 years in prison, although he has denied all charges from the start. A three-member bench reached a majority opinion (instead of a unanimous verdict) at the trial court in Athens.Tasos Theofilou was acquitted of severe charges in relation to “formation of and membership in a terrorist organization” (i.e. his alleged involvement in the urban guerrilla group Conspiracy of Cells of Fire), as well as possession of explosives and ordinance (these charges were also dropped, since the judges ruled that he was never a member of the CCF), forgery of five identification cards, use of a firearm, and two attempted homicides.However he was found guilty of two felony charges: participating in a robbery with his physical characteristics covered, and being an abettor in manslaughter committed in a calm mental state. He was also convicted of three misdemeanors: carrying a firearm, repeatedly forging (accusation relating to vehicles of the robbers), and accepting proceeds of crime (the getaway car of the robbers).In other words, the court decided that supposedly Theofilou (without being a member of the CCF or another organization) participated in the bank robbery on Paros Island in August 2012, but he was not the one who killed Dimitris Michas (the citizen who attempted to prevent the robbers’ escape). According to one of his defense lawyers, this is a decision taken on the basis of one and only indication (a controversial DNA sample on a hat which one of the robbers allegedly dropped). At least the imposition of life imprisonment was prevented, as he was not convicted of intentional manslaughter…Many facts of the case and evidence presented to the court argued in favor of his acquittal (e.g. none of the eyewitness recognized Theofilou during the trial). Nevertheless, as had happened in the case of anarchist prisoner Babis Tsilianidis, also in this proceeding the defendant was adjudged to be guilty solely on the basis of DNA, which was allegedly found on a mobile object.The court of first instance imposed: 16 years for abetting manslaughter, 15 years for committing robbery, 3 years for committing forgery, 2 years for carrying a firearm (plus a fine of 5,000 euros), and 2 years for accepting proceeds of crime; total: 38 years. The aggregate sentence is 25 years in prison. The comrade has the right to appeal against his conviction, but the appeal has no suspensive effect; that is, he must remain in prison until his next trial in the court of appeals (but in the meantime he can request that his prison sentence be suspended).In 2016, because the prosecution appealed, he will be tried again for the charges which he was acquitted of in the first trial (participation in the CCF and homicide).Media:Solidarity is Our Weapon booklet","No","","Geniko Katastima Kratisis Domokou","Greece","","Anastios","Theofilou","Fthiotida","35010","Domokos","","","D 2 ‘ Pteryga","Anarchist","","","Monday, August 24, 2037","Imprisoned","","","","Monday, April 24, 2017 - 15:59"

"Andrew Mickel","","Mar 13, 1979","","","Andrew “Andy” Mickel is a former resident of Springfield, Ohio. He graduated from Springfield’s North High School in 1998 and went on to serve three years with the U.S. Army’s 101st Airborne Division before attending Evergreen State College and becoming a journalist with Indymedia.org.  In December 2001, he went to Israel with a pro-Palestinian activist group pushing for an end to Israeli occupation. The following summer, he went to Colombia, South America, to study nonviolent resistance, and to Northern Ireland. In the Pacific Northwest, he joined protests against the World Trade Organization and was arrested in Seattle in April 2002 for interfering with a police officer.On November 19, 2002, at 1:27 am, Mickel shot and killed Officer David Mobilio of the Red Bluff, California Police Department. Mobilio was shot twice in the back, and once in the head at “very close range.” A handmade “Don’t Tread on Us” flag was left beside Mobilio’s body. There were no witnesses to the killing, and the crime would have gone unsolved had there not been Internet postings about the crime six days later. The postings read, “Hello Everyone, my name’s Andy. I killed a Police Officer in Red Bluff, California in a motion to bring attention to, and halt, the police-state tactics that have come to be used throughout our country. Now I’m coming forward, to explain that this killing was also an action against corporate irresponsibility.” It was signed “Andy McCrae,” an alias of Mickel’s.Mickel said that “prior to my actions in Red Bluff, I formed a corporation under the name ‘Proud and Insolent Youth Incorporated,’ so that I could use the destructive immunity of corporations and turn it on something that actually should be destroyed.” The name is taken from the novel Peter Pan written by Scottish author J. M. Barrie. Mickel wrote, “Just before their final duel and Capt. Hook’s demise, Hook said to Peter, ‘Proud and insolent youth, prepare to meet thy doom.’""Mickel insisted on representing himself during his trial.In April 2005, Mickel was convicted of one count of first-degree murder. He was subsequently sentenced to death, and is being held on Death Row at San Quentin State Prison while awaiting his automatic appeal to the California Supreme Court.In September 2009, The California Supreme Court, declaring that “In California, a criminal defendant has no right to represent himself or herself on appeal,” appointed attorney Lawrence A. Gibbs to represent Mickel for his automatic appeal. In November 2010, Gibbs received an extension to file the appeal brief by January 14, 2011.

"Charles “Chuck” Sims Africa","","Apr 02, 1960","","Move 9","Chuck Sims Africa is a member of the black liberation group MOVE and part of the MOVE 9, nine MOVE members all falsely accused for the murder of a police officer who was shot by friendly fire when the Philadelphia police raided their house.Chuck was born in Philadelphia, PA, in 1959 and was raised in West Philly. He has three sisters and a brother and grew up in the projects.My mother and father were divorced and I remember him briefly when I was about three or four. We settled down the bottom or “black bottom” on 39th and Reno Street.My grandfather (who also lived with us) died in 1972. At that time I thought he was the smartest person I had talked with. He talked about history and the second World War a lot. He told me about current events and was particularly fond of Angela Davis. I was always in search of knowledge and I wanted to be a part of something. I was never close to anyone in my family. Being the oldest male of the house, I was the “man of the house.” I used to “take orders” at the supermarket on Lancaster Ave. To try to make money when I was young and also sold papers. Later on I got into stealing and robbing.I remember seeing the Black Panther Party marching past our house and all through the neighborhood. Young dudes with rifles and shotguns flipping over police cars was a sight that blew my mind. I had never saw anything like it. I was too young to understand what was all going on throughout the country and that was the first time I had saw the BPP. We tried to march with them but our mothers kept us on the block.I met MOVE in 1973. It was a cold winter night. Me and a few of my gang stepped in my mother’s house and in the middle of the floor sat numerous men and women with long un-combed hair. The things that I heard stayed with me for the rest of my life. I had never heard anything like it. They talked about the court system, educational system, religion, news commentators, they spoke on science, prayer and time. The information they gave us was powerful and had a gripping force on me and my friends and really everybody with its clarity. As I listened I soon understood and witnessed this to be a fact! No one had ever explained the school system and its purpose before I met MOVE. There were things being told to me that I knew were true instinctively but I could never put them into words myself. I was always told all my life to go to school, obey the laws, etc., but never what was the purpose, whose education I was learning or why damn near every co I saw in my neighborhood was white and hostile to use blacks. My introduction to JOHN AFRICA’s Guidelines opened my mind up to actually use it and question the norm, the constraints of every day life, the lies, the hidden truths in a world of constant dishonesty.MOVE were the most united, together people I had ever met and I felt something coming over me and I knew right from the start that I would be a part of MOVE.There were more rap sessions or study sessions to come as I met more MOVE people and was being taught and read more of JOHN AFRICA’s Teachings. I went to be around MOVE in 1974 and would work at the car wash with MOVE and eat fresh fruit and vegetables that MOVE kept near its front porch. We all worked hard all day washing cars that we did for donations. It was always a real good family atmosphere whenever we did anything. We did everything as a family. MOVE’s belief is activity, everything on Earth has got to move. We ran our dogs for exercise; we also ran for one hour, then two hours, everyday in rain, sleet or snow as a family around the blocks of the neighborhood and we were in fantastic shape. I had never been in such good condition. We boxed in our exercise room did pull-ups, push-ups, and ran all day in the park. The more I stayed, the stronger I got. I had never met anyone like our COORDINATOR, JOHN AFRICA. The total trust and assurance being in that presence. It’s something that you just had to experience to fully comprehend.","Yes","Pennsylvania","SCI Dallas","United States","","Charles","Sims Africa #AM4975","Dallas","18612","","","","1000 Follies Rd.","MOVE","https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=OsY67-c7W17dfgK0sCS90NoWOBJ3EI3wRGYusn9oMHMq2a74NT_yn5Akxyq&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d5c97cbf3d75cb63effe5661cdf3adb6d","","","Imprisoned","OnAMovellja@gmail.com","https://www.facebook.com/pages/Free-the-MOVE-9/435412386474163","","Wednesday, April 5, 2017 - 11:58"

"Damien Camelio","","","","","Damien is an anarchist anti-fascist member of GADI (Groupe Action Directe International) who was arrested on Wednesday, December 7 2016 in Bretagne, charged with attacks against the Chambre of Commerce, a Jaguar dealership, and other targets during a demo that took place on April 14 between Paris’ 10th and 19th districts. This is his first letter out since being denied bail.  He was later sentenced to 10 months.I’m writing from Fleury, where I’m being held in preventative detention[1]. Since the charges against me are, as usual, totally boring and unimaginative, I wanted to offer a different telling of the lovely spring night of revolt, written by some true lovers of disorder, so that my comrades have an accurate and realistic depiction of what I’m alleged to have done: “Reportback on April 14: hold in the rage too long and it bursts out like it should”[2]I don’t want to complain, so I won’t give a detailed account of my arrest, similar as it was to all those that happen each day, here and around the world. However, it does seem important to mention a few things.During the search, the cops found some anarchist propaganda, namely some newspapers, brochures, posters, and tracts, as well as a few texts in the process of being translated. I refused to sign the papers dealing with the search as well as those for my being held taken into custody.After being transferred to the police station in Paris’ 19th district, I couldn’t reach my lawyer. I refused to be represented by a different one and so my hearing was held without the presence of a lawyer. I made this choice because my statement to the pigs fits in one line: “I am neither guilty nor innocent. I am an anarchist. I have nothing more to say to you.”Because I refused to make a statement, I don’t know at present what evidence they have on file. These lackeys of the powerful only told me that they have 8 DNA samples that match my genetic profile, and I know from having seen it that their folder on me is a brick, six or seven centimetres thick.To get more information, I’ll have to wait for my lawyer to have access to the folder and to come meet with me in prison. In any case, I’ve already made clear that I want the entire process and all my statements be made available to my comrades so that they can make whatever use of it they see fit. No copyright, no property, and without the censorship of the political bureau of any party, even imaginary ones [3].After a night spent in the holding cells of the Paris courthouse, a sort of medieval dungeon where the cops satisfy their sadistic urges, I was taken to court for an immediate summary trial [4]. Since my lawyer wasn’t there, I asked for a public defender at the last minute in order to get the date pushed back.The prosecutor, as usual, started bellowing a bunch of stupidness while making big gestures and sounding quite assured. She stated, for instance, that the residency declaration made by a comrade present in the room was inadmissible, because of grammatical mistakes in the text… And she continued, full of confidence, that of course, all opinions are respectable, even anarchy, but that is no excuse for the actions I’m accused of.We have to admit, if these clowns in black robes didn’t have power over the lives of others, they’d really be good for a laugh!But until such a time as the courts are destroyed and the judges are sent to their proper place, in the circus, we can’t let them say whatever idiotic thing that comes to mind. Regardless of the fantastic allegations of the prosecutor, anarchy is not an opinion, anarchy is a set of ideas that fit with a set of practices.Since what I’m accused of took place during a social movement that wasn’t a single mass, I want to make clear that I refuse the humanitarian solidarity of the unions or of any pacifist or citizens’ group that plays the role of intermediary for the transmission of power. My only desire is for the complicity of individuals in revolt who conspire in the shadows, ai ferri corti [5] with the existant and with power.My thanks to the comrade present at my arrest for the dignity she demonstrated in the face of the little soldiers of order, and thanks to all my comrades who reacted so quickly. Your support in the courtroom warmed my heart and gave me lots of strength.Don’t be too worried about me. Having spent several years in prison, I know its social codes very well, and I will doubtless find among the undesireables, of which I am a part, a few complicities rich in possibility.Because submission is never an option, because each individual act of revolt contains all the violence of social relations, because there remain countless stories to be written, across time and space, across the gray metropoles, inside and outside…… the fight continues.December 14 2016Damien Camélio Endnotes1] Pre-trial detention for people who don’t get bail 2] The link is in French, but the gist is that during a demo on April 14, as part of the movement against the new labour laws, a whole bunch of stuff got smashed, including hotels, art galeries, grocery stores, car shares, banks, and notably car dealerships.

"David Gilbert","","Oct 06, 1944","","","American radical organizer, author and prisoner David Gilbert was a founding member of Columbia University Students for a Democratic Society and member of The Weather Underground Organization. Following ten years underground he was arrested with members of the Black Liberation Army and other radicals following a botched armored car robbery in 1981. He is now a well-known prisoner serving time in upstate New York.Personal BackgroundDavid Gilbert grew up in a Jewish family in Brookline, Massachusetts, a suburb of Boston. Inspired in his teens by the Greensboro sit-ins and other events of the American Civil Rights Movement, he joined the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) at age seventeen. He entered Columbia University in 1962. In his junior year he helped to found the Independent Committee Against the War in Vietnam [ICV] and later the school’s chapter of Students for a Democratic Society. He travelled regularly to Harlem while working as a tutor, and saw Malcolm X speak at Barnard College in February 1965, experiences he describes as formative. Known by the late ’60s primarily as a young theorist, publishing articles in New Left Notes and other movement publications, he went on to play an organizing role in the April-May 1968 Columbia student strike.As Columbia SDS grew during the Spring 1967 term, Gilbert tended to return to the Columbia campus only to offer a “radical education” counter-course for Columbia SDS freshmen and sophomores in a lounge in Ferris Booth Hall. Most of his activism was centered downtown at the New School for Social Research or at the New York SDS Regional Office.Gilbert’s parents, while mainstream politically, were very committed to community service. By the time Gilbert entered Columbia in Fall, 1962, he had moved from being a left liberal democrat to being a social democrat. But by the fall of 1965, Gilbert was speaking on the sundial against the war in Viet Nam at ICV rallies, was a revolutionary communist and New Left radical on a political level, somewhat bohemian culturally and very intellectual, morally passionate and earnest. He always seemed to be in a pleasant and enthusiastic mood. He also seemed to be one of the New Left activists around campus who knew the most about any politically relevant subject. As an orator and agitator, Gilbert was also quite good. And as a day-to-day organizer, Gilbert was very hardworking.Students for a Democratic SocietyAfter graduating from Columbia in June 1966, Gilbert spent most of his days and evenings during the fall of 1967 downtown attending grad school at the New School, building an SDS chapter there or attending meetings at the New York SDS Regional Office. He and other New York Regional SDS activists were both working to build SDS and attempting to build an “adult,” non-student Movement for a Democratic Society [MDS] of ex-student radical professionals who had left the campus scene, for meaningless off-campus 9-to-5 jobs. In addition, Gilbert spent his spare-time studying Marx’s Das Kapital book and writing New Left theoretical papers on imperialism and U.S. domestic consumption, consumerism and “the new working-class.” In October 1967, Gilbert looked somewhat like Marx, himself, having grown a long beard.In 1969 SDS split into different ideological factions and the Weathermen emerged, its purpose being to build up armed struggle amidst young white Americans in support of the Black Panthers and other militant groups and also oppose the war in Vietnam via actions that “Bring the War Home.” Gilbert joined this group in 1969 with his friend Ted Gold, who in early 1970 would die in the infamous New York City townhouse explosion that killed three Weather members. The group’s participants went into hiding at this point, and the organization was renamed the Weather Underground.Weather UndergroundExactly what Gilbert did in the Weather Underground between 1970 and the group’s demise around 1976 is not known. Not on the group’s coordinating committee (the Weather Bureau) he did act as a regional leader. The Weather Underground committed several bombings and actions in this period against government and business targets. As support for the group began to wane on the left the pace of actions lessened and some members of the Weather Underground reemerged. Most were not proscecuted or did not serve time in prison despite having been sought by the police for years; police misconduct was the cause of many charges eventually being thrown out of court (see: COINTELPRO). Gilbert did surface from Summer, 1977, to Spring, 1979; he then went back underground. He and his partner Kathy Boudin remained active even following the birth of their son Chesa Boudin in August 1980.Revolutionary Armed Task ForceIn the late 1970s or early 1980s, Gilbert and other white activists took the name RATF (Revolutionary Armed Task Force). According to Gilbert, this was the name given to the alliance of white revolutionaries with and under that BLA unit's leadership. In 1981, this group participated along with several members of the BLA in an attempt to rob a Brinks armored car at the Nanuet Mall, near Nyack, New York. While Gilbert and Boudin waited in a U-Haul truck in a nearby parking lot, armed BLA members took another vehicle to the mall, where a Brinks truck was making a delivery. They confronted the guards. They began firing after the Brinks guard, Peter Paige, refused to drop his gun. Paige instead started to raise his weapon to fire, thus setting of the exchange. This resulted in the death of Paige and nearly severing the arm of guard Joe Trombino. The four then took $1.6 million in cash and sped off to transfer into the waiting U-Haul. The truck was soon stopped by police, who were looking for black, not white, perpetrators, and therefore did not suspect Gilbert and Boudin. Officers questioned the couple in the cab. The officers then went to the back of the truck and attempted to open it. The officers were attacked at this point by BLA members who emerged from the back of the vehicle. Two police officers, Waverly L. Brown and Edward J. O’Grady, died in the shootout. Gilbert fled the scene with other RATF and BLA members but was later caught by police, tried, and sentenced in 1983 to 75 years for three counts of felony murder*.  His extremely long sentence for participating in this action (especially when compared to Kathy Boudin’s 20-years-to-life, from which she has been paroled) may be due to his decision not to participate in his trial, not recognizing the authority of the state to try him.[Kuwasi's description aligns with David's and not the State's propaganda version of the shooting. Additional information and context can be found in Kuwasi's opening statement.]Life in PrisonGilbert co-founded an inmate peer education program on HIV and AIDS in the Auburn Correctional Facility in 1987, and a similar more successful project in Great Meadows Prison in Comstock following his transfer there.MediaHe has published book reviews and essays in a number of small/independent newspapers and journals which were collected into the anthology No Surrender: Writings from an Anti-Imperialist Political Prisoner (Abraham Guillen Press) in 2004. He has also published longer single pieces on the topic of misleading AIDS conspiracy theories and white working class political consciousness. In 2012, he published Love and Struggle: My Life in SDS, the Weather Underground, and Beyond.The 2003 documentary The Weather Underground featured interview segments with Gilbert, raising his profile beyond those in the small political prisoner support network who have been following his progress since his incarceration. The DVD release of The Weather Underground features a longer interview with Gilbert as an extra.* It is important to understand that anyone involved in a felony like robbery, even if they do not have a weapon or do not shoot, still carries full legal responsibility for all deaths that result from that felony. Gilbert writes further in the 5/29/17 letter: ""While it looks obvious that the more severe sentences came from our refusal to participate, it's not true. Anyone, even non-revs, I met in prison, convicted of felony murder of police gets the maximum sentence. After our trial, Kathy, thankfully, was in a strong legal position to make a plea bargain. But in general, whether they fight it in court or not, when a cop is killed those convicted of felony murder get the max possible.""","No","New York","Wende Correctional Facility","United States","","David","Gilbert #83-A-6158","Alden","14004-1187","","","","3040 Wende Road","Anti-Imperialist","","Wende Correctional Facility","","Imprisoned","","","","Tuesday, June 20, 2017 - 11:27"
"Debbie Sims Africa","","Aug 04, 1956","","Move 9","Debbie Sims Africa is a member of the black liberation group MOVE, mother of two and political prisoner who has served over 25 years in prison after the house she was living in was attacked by Philadelphia police. During the raid an officer was killed in friendly fire and all nine MOVE members in the house were falsely charged with his murder.  Debbie has been up for parole since 2008, but each time she has been denied.  Find out more about the MOVE 9 and the fight for Debbie and her fellow MOVE family’s freedom at www.onamove.com and move9parole.blogspot.comPersonal BackgroundDebbie was born August 4th, 1956.  As a young adult she joined the MOVE organization.  The group was driven by founder John Africa’s teachings strong beliefs which emphasized animal rights and sustainable living.  They swore off drugs, some overcoming past addictions, and lived a life of hard physical work and self-discipline. MOVE members watched neighbors’ pets, helped the elderly with shoveling their sidewalks and with home repairs, worked with recently released imprisoned people to overcome addictions and meet parole requirements and other community activities.  They also staged protests against the police, zoos and were active at public speaking events.They bought a Victorian house which served as the groups headquarters and home.  Debbie fell in love with fellow MOVE member Mike Africa.  They soon married and had a daughter together.  As Debbie was starting her family and continuing her work with MOVE the police had begun escalating their harassment and repression of MOVE members.  People were routinely arrested and beaten.  The city began to pressure MOVE to leave their house, which they refused to do.Legal Case1978 Stand-OffPhiladelphia police lay seige on MOVE headquarters.Tensions reached a boiling point on August 8th, 1978.  Months prior the police had turned off the water to the house and set up a blockade preventing any food or aid to be sent in to the family.  After the MOVE family still refused to leave their home the city finally raided the house.  Police began firing on the house and in the flurry of bullets an officer went down.Debbie, there in the house with her 23 month old and 8 1/2 weeks pregnant with her second child, recounted that day in writing.  They were all huddled in the basement for protection and then,“Before we knew it, water was comin through the hole where the window used to be. The wave of water sprayed thru the fire hose took up the entire width of the window and the length of the window hole, throwing 2×4 oak beams across the room slamming our big dogs up against the wall, and literally tearing the house apart from the inside, then a second wave of water came through another would be window and we were caught in a cross fire of water.All I could do was scream. I was scared. Dogs and beams were flying everywhere and I cried when I saw our dogs being hurt and killed. I held tight to my baby and stayed low while the men hovered around us to protect us.When the cops started shooting I closed my eyes and just held tight to my stomach and protectively shielded them the best that I could from flying debris and planks. It was the most frightening situation I’ve ever been in.At one point, I couldn’t even see the baby’s face because of the smoke bombs and tear gas thrown in the basement by the cops that was also choking me, all the while the water level was rising (we found out later during our trial from one of the lawyers appointed to represent us, that when a mixture of smoke an water are thrown together it acts as a deadly weapon and could have suffocated all of us).I personally thought we were gonna die. It was only a miracle that we didn’t die, with the way those cops were shootin at us (some shootin point blank in our faces close range), the way the firemen had water getting into the basement windows and the way they gassed us.”Consuewella and Janet Africa carry children out of the flooded basement.All five men were brutally beaten.  Delbert’s beating was caught, unbeknownst to police, on camera.  Police threw tear gas into the basement and MOVE adults began bringing the children out.  Debbie’s baby was snatched from her arms by Philadelphia cops in front of the house and Debbie was arrested, along with eight others for the murder of a police officer during the stand-off.Evidence Destroyed The police immediately razed the entire property, destroying any potential evidence that would help prove that none of the MOVE 9 could have possibly killed the officer (especially all nine of them!).  No efforts were made to preserve the crime scene, inscribe chalk marks or measure ballistic angles.The Murder TrialAll nine co-defendants elected to represent themselves, bringing their politics, wit and tireless cross-examinations into the courtroom process.  The judges frequently grew impatient with MOVE members and would throw them out of the courtroom.Move 9 Removed from Their Own TrialIn the middle of the trial, police raided a Richmond MOVE home where two MOVE women and many children of the MOVE 9 were living while their parents were on trial. MOVE demanded the trial be recessed until they could establish the location and welfare of their children, but the judge refused.  Some of the parents within MOVE 9 were removed after they repeatedly objected to the continuation of the trial.  Eventually, all nine were removed from the courtroom.  The trial then proceeded with public-appointed back up lawyers.  All nine defendants were barred from participating in the last 47 days of their own trial.The judge went on to declare all nine of the MOVE members guilty of third degree murder, conspiracy, and multiple counts of attempted murder and aggravated assault.  They were all sentenced to between 30 and 100 years.Life in PrisonDebbie visiting with her son and granddaughter.Debbie Gives Birth to Mike Jr.On September 15, 1978 Debbie had her son, Mike Jr., in her prison cell naturally without the aid of doctors, nurses, or prison staff.  For several hours afterwards, Debbie held her son, anguished over the inevitable time she would have to give him up.  She eventually told the prison staff of the delivery and then she lost her second child.Both her son and daughter are now parents themselves.Debbie with her son Michael, Jr.She continues to struggle for a better world inside her cell.  She, along with her MOVE sisters have prevented prisoners from committing suicide, resolved racial disputes, and helped keep prisoners out of trouble so that they can get out on good behavior to reunite with their families again.Support StatementsHuman Rights Coalition Parole Support LetterHoward Zinn Letter of SupportMediaWritings of Debbie AfricaDebbie Africa account of 1978 Stand-OffDebbie Africa Statement in Support of PalestineVideosMOVE DocumentaryDebbie’s son, Mike Jr., Interview","Yes","Pennsylvania","SCI Cambridge Springs","United States","","Debbie","Sims Africa #OO-6307","Cambridge Springs","16403-1238","","","","451 Fullerton Ave.","MOVE","https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=OsY67-c7W17dfgK0sCS90NoWOBJ3EI3wRGYusn9oMHMq2a74NT_yn5Akxyq&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d5c97cbf3d75cb63effe5661cdf3adb6d","","","Imprisoned","onamovellja@aol.com","https://www.facebook.com/pages/Free-the-MOVE-9/435412386474163","","Thursday, July 7, 2016 - 13:54"

"Delbert Orr Africa","","Apr 02, 1946","","Move 9","Personal BackgroundDelbert Orr Africa was born April 2, 1946.  As a young man he joined the Chicago Chapter of the Black Panther Party.  In 1969 the FBI put forth false warrants on the Chicago BPP leadership, including Delbert.  He and others then fled to Canada.  They struggled to get any financial support while in exile and received support from others in the struggle. Many reports have listed them as carrying out bank expropriations to sustain themselves, which is false.In September 1969, he had a daughter Yvonne Malaika with Christina May, a Chicago Black Panther Party officer while in Canada. In October of 1969 Delbert had been back in Chicago.  As he was driving back to Canada he crashed and ended up in the hospital.In March of 1970 Delbert, along with his family and three other friends, decided to head down to Philadelphia because one of them was originally from there.  It was there in Philadelphia that he met members of the MOVE organization.  He was inspired by their uplifting approach to revolution and stayed on with them.He ended up becoming Minister of Confrontation and Security for the MOVE Organization.Legal CaseDelbert was arrested on August 8, 1978 as one of the MOVE 9. When the police raided the MOVE house, Delbert was the one was videotaped being beaten brutally by police.  He suffered a broken jaw and fractured eye socket from the attack. They were each wrongly convicted of murder, assault and conspiracy by the late Judge Edwin S. Malmed and each sentenced to 30-100 years in prison.Life in PrisonDelbert started his prison sentence out in the “hole” for 6 years in a Dallas prison for refusing to break his religious beliefs and cut his hair.   In December 1989 he was transferred out of Dallas because they had riots at Camp Hill prison, which though he wasn’t even a part of, the state prison used as an excuse to send him to the Federal system.In federal prison he was under 23 hour lock up, 24 hours lock up on weekends where they wouldn’t even let him out for yard. He stayed in long-term solitary confinement until May of that year. Then they transferred him to another prison.At the new prison he was offered a job in the printing shop. They were mystified when he turned them down because pay was good for prison work- $86 a month. Delbert explained the situation,“I said, ‘Naw, I don’t want that.’ They said, ‘Wait a minute. This is just starting off, you can move right on up.’ I said, ‘Look, I’ve been in the hole for 6 years. I want some air! I don’t want no career in the prison.’ So they assigned me to the yard detail. And that was it, I loved that. I stayed in there a year and they shipped me back to state. When I got back they put me in the hole for about 3 weeks, then I got out, they put me in population.","Yes","Pennsylvania","SCI Dallas","United States","","Delbert","Orr Africa #AM4985","Dallas","18612","Drawer K","","","1000 Follies Road","MOVE","https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=OsY67-c7W17dfgK0sCS90NoWOBJ3EI3wRGYusn9oMHMq2a74NT_yn5Akxyq&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d5c97cbf3d75cb63effe5661cdf3adb6d","","","Imprisoned","onamovellja@aol.com","https://www.facebook.com/pages/Free-the-MOVE-9/435412386474163","","Saturday, April 8, 2017 - 13:40"

"Doug Wright","https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/37YXSRCKU6OB8","May 31, 1985","","Cleveland 4","It was during the reign of Ronald Reagan, a decade that signaled the rapid decline of all that still lay natural, sane, and pure.  Central America was brutalized, unions were busted, record number of millionaires became billionaires, punk rock took the offensive, and on May 31, 1985 Douglas Wright entered this world.                            What do children need?  They need love, food, and warm beds.  Fresh air and stimulating conversation is good, too.At the young age of fourteen, Doug decided he had all the mental and physical abuse he could possibly handle from the hands of his mothers’ boyfriends, and made his way out to L.A. Children exposed to mental and physical abuse experience rapid and intense emotions; fear, anger, confusion, guilt and anxiety.  Many develop trust issues, have strong feelings of restlessness, and frequently become addicted to drugs and alcohol.In L.A. Doug became involved in radical leftist activities and anti-war rallies.  He eventually made his way to San Francisco and got involved in ANSWER SF rallies. At the age of fifteen, during his time in California, Doug became addicted to heroin.       Almost as dangerous as heroin, Doug picked up the habit of train hopping.  He made his way out to New York City and on one occasion accidentally found himself in Anderson, Indiana.   In Anderson Doug met Stephen Zumbrun.  Stephen had a music company called “Piradical Productions” which hosted all age punk rock shows.  These folks became Doug’s new family for the next five years.Doug was in Cleveland during the Occupy movement and became the target of an elaborate FBI setup operation.Many people in this country are born into lives of relative solitude and comfort.  Doug’s life has been a series of tests, trials, and tribulations.Douglas Wright is now serving eleven and a half years at Hazelton,  a maximum security prison.  Hazelton is known to be one of the three most violent prisons in the nation and is in lockdown most of the time.  If Doug survives this latest test and manages to walk out of that hellhole, then there’ll be one tough bastard standing before us.  One that I’m honored and proud to call comrade.  One that has shown nothing but grit, sand, and integrity.  And I know, if you got the time, he’d surely appreciate a letter from you.As an endnote I’d like to add that Doug is not afraid of being sent to a CMU (communication management unit) and plans to tell his side of the story.  Consequences be damned.  He would also like to add that he wishes the Feds to get fucked and that the State needs to be smashed most thoroughly.Doug would love photos and news articles from the outside.“I first met Doug at Occupy Cleveland as part of the logistics working group whose job it was to put the camp together, keep the kitchen dry, fit all of the Occupiers on what small piece of sidewalk we had, and to keep the camp from falling apart. This large task was only taken on by roughly 3 or 4 people. Doug also stayed up all hours of the night to keep the camp safe, and assisted me countless times in the Occupy kitchen where we would redistribute food not only throughout the camp but to anyone with an empty stomach that passed by. On the streets of downtown Cleveland, that’s a lot of folks.Doug is my friend because he has proven a hundred times over that he is a man of hard work and generosity. He had been on the road most of his life and came to Cleveland with nothing but the clothes on his back. Still, when he got to Cleveland he gave all he could to help those around him: giving without taking, sharing his labor, his stories, and his ideas. Whenever Doug had the funds, he would go out and get bacon and eggs for breakfast and feed whomever was hungry."" – Gus","Yes","South Carolina","FCI Edgefield","United States","","Doug","Wright #57973-060","Edgefield","29824","","","","P.O.

"Edward “Eddie” Goodman Africa","","Oct 31, 1949","","Move 9","On the MOVE! My name is Edward (Goodman) Africa. I was born in Philadelphia and raised in a Christian home by both parents-I’m one of six children. I grew up in the streets of Phila., began drinking at the young age of fourteen and went on to drugs (marijuana, speed, pills, and heroin). All by the age of fifteen. I went to jail for the first time in 1963 at the age of sixteen for “receiving stolen goods.” I got out of jail in 1967, but went back every summer after that. I started looking for something Black as I started to believe that all whites were evil. I supported the Black Panthers, the B.L.A. and finally joined the group known as the “Black Muslims.”I was still involved in street life: stealing, drugs, parties, women, etc…Most of my arrests were between 1967-1973 (when I joined MOVE) were based on getting stopped by cops for nothing and refusing to be searched while being slammed against a car. When I complained, I got roughed up and when I resisted I’d get beat more. Of course I’d end up getting charged with assault and resisting arrest.As I learned more about this particular Muslim group, I thought I had answers, but I still felt unsatisfied and the racism in me grew. About this time, one of my brothers and my cousin came to visit me in jail.

But such an invitation can no longer be accepted: hundreds of angry people, most of them kids in their teens with no connection whatsoever with political groups or organizations, just took to the streets of Rome to destroy the misery of the existent, attack banks and shops, and finally engage in a battle against the police in Piazza San Giovanni.As far as we know 12 kids were arrested that day, almost all of them underage. Two days later, on October 17, police raided the houses of dozens of anarchists all over Italy in search of ‘weapons’ supposedly used during the demonstration. The searches, carried out without warrant but relying on the special powers granted by article 41 TULPS (alleged possession of weapons and explosive material), came to no result.This communiqué of Asilo Occupato from Turin, picked up among many others, offers a beautiful insight into the event.

"Fred “Muhammad” Burton","","Dec 15, 1946","","","Fred Burton is one of the Philly 5 a group of men accused of an alleged attack on a police station that left one officer killed. He was sentenced to a life term for murder. Burton has maintained his innocence since his arrest.Personal BackgroundPrior to his incarceration, Fred worked for a phone company, was a well-respected member of his community and his wife was preparing to have twins, his third and fourth child.Legal CaseIn 1970, Fred was accused and then convicted of participating in the planning of the murder of Philadelphia police officers. While the plan was allegedly to blow up a police station, what occurred was that a police officer was shot and killed allegedly by members of a radical group called “the Revolutionaries.”Only one witness, Marie Williams, who was the wife of co-defendant and primary actor, Hugh Williams, testified as to the relationship between, Fred and “the Revolutionaries.” Fred was not accused of being at the scene of the crime. At Fred’s trial, Marie Williams was compelled by order of the court to testify. Ms. Williams inculpated Fred by testifying that on one occasion, she had heard someone in her basement, a floor below her, say, “Let’s off some pigs.” She did not accuse Fred of making those statements. She only testified to Fred’s presence at that meeting. Ms. Williams also testified that besides the one meeting, she had no knowledge of the content of the meetings.The Commonwealth intentionally struck every African-American from the active jury. The all white jury unanimously convicted Fred after being purposefully misled by the Commonwealth and Marie Williams.The testimony of the Commonwealth’s star witness, Marie Williams, was marred by contradiction. Marie Williams initially claimed Fifth Amendment at the first two of three preliminary hearings and refused to testify. At Fred’s third preliminary hearing, Marie Williams completely exonerated Fred. She testified that she had no knowledge of “the Revolutionaries” or of Fred’s involvement with that group. After the third preliminary, the case was held for trial. Marie Williams was then subjected to a closed immunity hearing and compelled to testify at trial.While searching through records that his family had obtained, Fred came across several items of exculpatory evidence: 1) the transcript of Marie Williams’ previously undisclosed immunity hearing, 2) the two alleged original statements by Marie Williams given to the police after the murder, and 3) a pretrial letter authored and signed by Marie Williams to the prosecutor. This letter was submitted as evidence in the immunity hearing. It stated that the prosecutor and the police were intimidating Marie Williams and forcing her to lie in court. Most importantly, the same letter stated Marie Williams has no knowledge that Fred Burton participated in any meetings or crimes.Legal AppealsIn 2002, his lawyer sued to have him released from indefinite solitary confinement. In September 2003, Fred brought a pro se Post Conviction Petition to vindicate his rights based on the newly discovered documents along with essential documents from the record that prove the occurrence of a fraud on the court, a gross miscarriage of justice and his innocence.The present PCRA trail court has refused to address any substantive claims of Fred Burton.In early 2007, Fred’s lawyer filed a new PCRA brief to the Court of Appeals and recently the court ruled that it will schedule a hearing for oral arguments on July 10th.Life in PrisonUpon being sentenced to prison in 1972 Mr. Burton was automatically a target for the prison guards due to the racially charged atmosphere and the nature of the conviction.  Mr. Burton became an organizer in prison and a teacher.  His work was not appreciated by the authorities.  Of the forty years Mr. Burton has been in prison, thirty three of them have been in a maximum security facility.  Eleven of those years have been spent in solitary confinement. ","Yes","Pennsylvania","SCI Somerset","United States","","Fred","Burton AF 3896","Somerset","15510","","","","1590 Walters Mill Rd","Black/New Afrikan Liberation","","","","Imprisoned","jonathangettleman@advocateforjustice.net","","","Monday, April 24, 2017 - 16:20"

Among the six people (five men and one woman) later imprisoned were Giorgos Karagiannidis and Alexandros Mitrousias, both of whom had warrants out for their arrest since September 2009 on charges related to the Fire Cells Conspiracy case.

In the garage, police also found three submachine guns, seven pistols of different manufacture, 50 kilograms of ANFO explosive, four hand grenades, three AK-47 assault rifles, a silencer, a large quantity of bullets, and 200 grams of TNT. At another location, were found more than 30 fake ID cards, as well as other “contraband.” Karagiannidis and Mitrousias both denied having any relationship to the Fire Cells Conspiracy. Their arrest warrants, as well as warrants for others, were issued at the end of September 2009 on the basis of fingerprints found at Hatzimichelakis’ home—the notorious “safe house” in the Halandri neighborhood, where everything began.

Last news - https://avtonom.org/en/news/appeal-support-ilya-romanov 46-year-old anarchist Ilya Romanov was wounded in Nizhnii Novgorod. The blast which occurred late at night severely injured his left hand and burned his face. Ilya was taken to hospital where doctors amputated his arm. Romanov explained for police that he unwarily used a pyrotechnic device.In December 2013 Romanov was charged by Article 205 through Article 30 of the Criminal Code of Russian Federation (""attempt a terrorist attack""). There is no reason for terrorism charges because there is no corpus delicti. Article 205 implies committing acts ""frightening people and endanger the lives of the person causing significant property damage or other serious consequences in order to influence decision-making authorities or international organizations"". It is obvious that in this situation there could be no intimidation, no danger of death or significant property damage as a firecracker was too underpowered, and Ilya hurt just because the blast was occurred in his hands.Ilya got involved in anarchist movement in late 80's in Nizhni Novgorod, which was back then named Gorky. One of his first actions in Soviet era was publication of an anarchist leaflet, almost every copy of which ended up to KGB archives. This is third time he is suspected of involvement in armed struggle. First time he was detained in Moscow in October of 1998, as a suspected member of underground armed group ""New Revolutionary Alternative"". Eventually he was sentenced to involuntary treatment in mental hospital, and released in turn of year 2002.Ilya did not spent long time in freedom, as already in December 2002 he was detained in Ukraine, as one of the suspected members of underground revolutionary organisation. Eventually he spent 10 years in prison.

"Jaan Karl Laaman","","Mar 21, 1948","","Ohio 7 (United Freedom Front)","Jaan Karl Laaman grew up in Roxbury, MA and Buffalo, NY. His family emigrated to the US from Estonia when he was a child.He is currently serving a 53 year prison sentence for his role in the bombings of United States government buildings while a member of the United Freedom Front, an American leftist group which robbed banks, bombed buildings, and attacked law enforcement officers in the 1980s.Political LifeIn the 1960s Laaman worked in Students for a Democratic Society, community organizations and advocated against the Vietnam War and racism. He facilitated youth development in the Black Panther Party and the Puerto Rican Young Lords street gang.New Hampshire Case:In 1972 he was arrested and charged with bombing a Richard Nixon reelection headquarters building and a police station in New Hampshire and was sentenced to 20 years. However, he was released in 1978 after winning an appeal and having his sentence reduced.The Ohio 7 case:Jaan quickly stepped back into the political life and in 1979 he and Kazi Toure helped to organize the Amandla Festival of Unity. This concert, which featured Bob Marley, helped to fight racism in Boston, where it was held, and raised money to send to freedom fighters in South Africa. This activity along with the anti-racist and community security work he was doing led to increased police and Klan harassment, so Jaan, once again, went underground and joined the armed clandestine movement.Jaan joined up with a group known as the United Freedom Front, which consisted of former members of the Sam Melville-Jonathan Jackson and other revolutionaries. The group targeted government institutions and major corporations that had ties to the South African Apartheid system or right-wing paramilitaries in Central America. This included taking actions directly against the South African and United States governments, attacking various government buildings.The UFF continued their activities for several years, funding their actions through bank expropriations. Then on February 7, 1982, Jaan Laaman and another UFF member, Kazi Toure, were involved in a shoot out with police. While Jaan managed to escape, Kazi was arrested. Despite the arrest, the group continued their operations. However, on November 4, 1984, five members of the group, including Jaan Laaman were arrested. Nearly six months later, the last two remaining members were arrested and referred to collectively as the Ohio 7.While originally charged with seditious conspiracy, Laaman was found guilty of five bombings, one attempted bombing, and criminal conspiracy, and was sentenced to 53 years in prison.Media:Jaan is an editor of 4 Struggle Mag which regularly published his writings.  He also has a podcast available at http://freejaan.blogspot.com/.

"Jalil Muntaqim","","Oct 18, 1951","","New York 3","Jalil became affiliated with the Black Panther Party at age 18.  Less than 2 months before his 20th birthday he was captured with Albert Nuh Washington in a midnight shootout with San Francisco police. He was subsequently charged with a host of revolutionary activities including the assassination of two police in New York City. It is for this that he is currently serving a 25 years – life sentence in New York State. His case is known as the New York 3 case as his co-defendants include Nuh Washington and Herman Bell. He was also implicated in the San Francisco 8 case, and pled guilty to a lesser offense.Legal Case:On May 21, 1971, two New York City police officers were fatally shot. This shooting occurred within the context of two major national trends: the growth of black revolutionary groups such as the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense and, later, its armed wing, the Black Liberation Army; and at the same time, the FBI operation under Director J. Edgar Hoover, with the cooperation of the Nixon administration, to destroy the leaders and memberships of both mainstream civil rights and militant black organizations. This counterintelligence operation, called COINTELPRO, targeted black leaders by infiltrating the Black Liberation Movement, framing members of the movements for crimes, and even murdering them, in order to get them off the streets and out of contact with the community. The shooting of these two police officers also came immediately after the infamous trial of the ""Panther 21,"" a case in New York against 21 members of the BPP charged with planning ""terrorist"" acts. After nearly a two year trial, all 21 defendants were acquitted.On May 26, 1971, only 5 days after the crime FBI Director Hoover was called to the White House, and in a secret meeting with President Richard Nixon, John Erlichman, the Domestic Advisor to the President, as well as members of the Watergate plumbers. They discussed this case and established the FBI would solve the crime under the code name NEWKILL, or New York killings. It is believed that in this meeting, the FBI and White House conspired to frame Black Panthers for the killings.Furthermore, on May 19, 1971, only three days before the shooting, two other NYPD officers were injured. Dhoruba bin Wahad (formerly Richard Moore), was convicted in that case and served 19 years in prison for attempted murder. At the time of his arrest, Dhoruba was a ranking member of the Black Panther Party and a target of COINTELPRO. Eventually, in 1990, he was released due to a successful appeal based on information found in COINTELPRO documents, which detailed how evidence was manufactured and testimony perjured. Similar evidence has not been allowed as evidence in the case of the New York 3.Three months after the killings, on August 28, 1971, Jalil Abdul Muntaqim (Anthony Bottom) and Albert Nuh Washington were arrested in San Francisco during an armed confrontation with police. Their arrests came only one week after the assassination of BPP Field Marshall, George Jackson. They were later charged with the New York killings. Nearly two years later, Herman Bell was arrested in New Orleans. Also arrested and charged in the case were Gabriel and Francisco Torres although charges the two brothers were acquitted due to lack of evidence.The first trial, then against the New York 5 (including the Torres brothers), ended in a mistrial. In that trial, only one vote was cast to convict Nuh Washington. The Torres brothers were acquitted in the second trial. But at the end of a second trial, in 1975, the New York Three-Nuh, Jalil, and Herman--were convicted of first degree murder, weapons possession, and conspiracy.The hung jury in the first trial was largely due to the jury's doubt that a fingerprint near the scene of the crime belonged to Herman Bell. In order to ensure that this piece of tampered evidence would uphold in the second trial, the FBI was brought in to back up the findings of the NYPD. What wasn't presented to the jury was that the FBI and the NYPD had different stories as to whether the fingerprint matched Bell or not. The defense argued that the print bad actually been lifted from Jalil's San Francisco apartment by the FBI. This is only one example of how the NYPD and FBI worked together to ensure a conviction in the second trial.All three members of the New York Three were specifically named in COINTELPRO documents as members of the black liberation movement who had to be ""neutralized."" These documents, and the media smear campaign enacted by the FBI and the White House, claimed that these community and human rights activists were ""terrorists."" This domestic program of political repression was revealed by a 1976 congressional committee, the Church Commission, to have utilized extra-legal methods to neutralize social justice movements, including surveillance, beatings, torture, harassment, instigating violent feuds between rival individuals and organizations, coercion and intimidation of witnesses, isolating and bad jacketing influential leaders, as well as outright murder. In fact, a major reason that many BPP and BLA members were forced to go underground and arm themselves was the deadly FBI-instigated split in the party between factions led by Eldridge Cleaver and Huey P. Newton.Despite the media perception that the BPP were ""terrorists,"" the main activities conducted by the New York Three and other members of the BPP were running programs designed to serve the community, such as the Free Breakfast program for children; health care programs, such as sickle-cell anemia testing and lead poisoning prevention; legal and political education; and anti-drug activities.Media: Writings by JalilLetter from Jalil's Mom Billie: A Mother's Cry in support of her son's release.Videos of Jalil discussing the Case of the New York 3, Cointelpro, Plutocracy and some history leading to the formation of the Jericho Movement, of which Jalil is a co-founder. Also check out the videos from an interview with Jalil in 1988 by Paper Tiger TV, especially Part 3, which includes a response to Badge of the Assassin with Safiyah Bukhari, Attorney Brian Glick and the New York 3.","Yes","New York","Shawangunk Correctional Facility","United States","","Anthony","J.

"Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, Imam","https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/17UR1J25KRCME","Oct 04, 1943","","","Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin, formerly H. Rap Brown, was a black liberation leader serving as the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and late the Justice Minister of the Black Panther Party.  He went on to convert to Islam, became an Imam and helped found a mosque in Atlanta.Early LifeImam Jamil was born in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. In the late 1960s, he was known as H. Rap Brown. After Islam, he adopted the name Jamil Al-Amin.In 1960, he enrolled at Southern University in Georgia and majored in sociology. ""I lived near Louisiana State University, and I could see this big fine school with modern buildings and it was for whites. Then there was Southern University, which was about to fall in and that was for the niggers."" Although a good student, he left school in 1964 before finishing his undergraduate degree.Influenced by many writers committed to the struggle of African-Americans for freedom, 19-year-old H. Rap Brown found the environment around Howard University in Washington, D.C. inspiring and motivating when he visited his brother who was studying there. He moved to Washington, D.C. and became got involved in activism for social justice.Student Nonviolent Coordinating CommitteeIn 1966, Brown became a field organizer for the SNCC in Greene County, Alabama. This was one of the first examples of his involvement in the civil rights movement, which characterized American politics in the 1960s.By 1967, at the age of 23, Brown was elected the chairman of the SNCC after Stokely Carmichael, one of its founding members, was ousted. During Carmichael's chairmanship, the SNCC moved from a philosophy of nonviolence to that of ""Black Power,"" by encouraging African-Americans to move to other forms of political and cultural empowerment. Newsweek magazine described the new chairman as:... a disenchanted ex-poverty worker who affects sunglasses indoors and out, a droopy mustache, a bushy ""natural"" coif and a curdled view of the white world…He preaches armed eye-for-an-eye self-defense for Negroes and packs a 12-gauge ""cracker gun"" in his own dusty Plymouth.A national figure, H. Rap Brown was in great demand as speaker. In July 1967, he addressed a civil rights rally in Cambridge, Maryland. Brown urged about 400 people to fight fire with fire. ""Black folks built America, and if America don't come around, we're going to burn America down,"" he is quoted as saying. As he was escorting a lady to her home, some persons fired at him from the bushes. He was injured by a shotgun pellet to his forehead. Subsequently, rioting broke out. Brown was accused of inciting the riot, and with the charge pending, he was arrested. A federal judge gave him the maximum sentence of five years in 1968.At a rally in Oakland on Feb. 17, 1968, he and Stokely Carmichael were made honorary officers of the Black Panther Party in a merger of the two groups. Brown was named minister of justice for the Black Panther Party. Founded in October, 1966, in Oakland, California by Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale, the BPP posed a threat to the predominantly white power structure of the time and an undeclared war was being waged against the Panthers.Going UndergroundWhile the sentence for a 1968 arms conviction was on appeal, and as the state of Maryland was preparing to try him for the Cambridge riot, Brown went into hiding in 1970. The FBI added him to its ""Most Wanted"" list. Brown eluded the FBI for a year and a half, reappearing after 17 months on October 16, 1971. With three supporters who had joined him, he led an attack on a New York City bar, targeted for its exploitation of the community. A shootout with police ensued and Brown was wounded and captured.While Brown was in jail, waiting for his trial, he converted to Islam. A fellow prisoner suggested he name himself ""the trustworthy"" or ""Al-Amin"" in Arabic. He adopts the name Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin. He was sentenced to five-to-fifteen years in Attica State Prison. After three years in various state prisons, Imam Jamil won parole in 1976. His total jail and prison time was five years, including two years in jail prior to sentencing.Current CaseIn August of 1995, Imam Jamil was arrested in connection with a shooting the previous month of a young man in the neighborhood. He was charged with aggravated assault after the man claimed Imam Jamil shot him. Later, however, this man withdrew this statement, saying he was pressured by authorities to identify Imam Jamil as the assailant.On March 16th, 2000, Fulton County Deputy Sheriff Ricky Kinchen is shot and later dies. Another deputy Aldranon English is wounded after being shot by a man outside Imam Jamil's store. They were trying to deliver an arrest warrant to Imam Jamil. The warrant was for failure to appear in court in January 2000 on charges of theft by receiving stolen property and impersonating an officer. Those charges date back to incident in May 1999. English identified the shooter in the March 16 incident as Imam Jamil.Imam Jamil is arrested in Lowndes County, Alabama, following a four-day U.S.-wide manhunt. A grand jury in Atlanta indicts Imam Jamil for murder in connection with the shooting death of deputy Kinchen the previous month. He is indicted on one count of murder, four counts of felony murder, two counts of aggravated assault and six other lesser charges.The State of Georgia announced that it planned to pursue a death penalty conviction of Imam Jamil Abdullah Al-Amin. From 1992 to 1997, the FBI and Atlanta police investigated the former black militant once known as H. Rap Brown in connection with everything from domestic terrorism to gunrunning to 14 homicides in Atlanta's West End, according to police investigators' reports, FBI documents and interviews. The FBI investigation ended in February 1996. The Atlanta police investigation ended in August 1997 without any charging him of any crime. In his only public comment on his arrest, Al-Amin called it a ""government conspiracy."" Atlanta Journal-Constitution (April 1/00)On June 2000, Otis Jackson, 26, confessed to killing the police officer, but later recants. Imam Jamil's defense team is not informed about it.

"Janet Holloway Africa","","Apr 13, 1951","","Move 9","Janet Holloway Africa is a member of the black liberation group MOVE, a mother and part of the MOVE 9, nine MOVE members all falsely accused for the murder of a police officer who was shot by friendly fire when the Philadelphia police raided their house.Personal BackgroundJanet Halloway Africa was born in New Jersey, 1951 to a single mom of twenty.  Her mother and grandmother worked tirelessly to support Janet and her siblings, but eventually her mother gave her to Janet’s aunt so she could have a better life.With her aunt Janet was taken care of, able to take dance lessons, play on sports teams, and all in all enjoy life.  When she was 11, Janet’s mother had been able to get her life on track more and was able to be in Janet’s life again.  She spent the next few years back and forth between her aunt and mother.Janet lived a comfortable, suburban lifestyle but after graduating high school she was still not satisfied with her life.  She continued on, working several different jobs but never really happy with what she was doing.  She met a man, they got married and together had a daughter.In Janet’s words she recalls,“I remember sitting in my rocking chair with my newborn baby in my arms felling the same way my mother felt, wanting something better for my daughter; wanting her to be safe, happy, free of the hurt, pain disappointment and disillusion of this cold, cruel, prejudiced system.”Janet tried to find the answers to her questions in religion, but was against left disappointed in people’s hypocrisy and double lives.Janet Joins MOVEShe heard from a friend about a group called MOVE.  They were having a rap session coming up and Janet decided to attend.  She was instantly moved by the words of MOVE founder John Africa.“I can’t even put into words the feeling I got hearing John Africa’s teaching.  It gripped me in a way that I’ve never never been gripped before.  For the first time in my life I felt there was hope for me and there was reasons why I was so detached, dissatisfied, and unhappy.”Janet went on to join MOVE and became an outspoken activist and organizer.Police Attack JanetAs MOVE began to grow in numbers and strength they faced increased harrassment and abuse at the hands of the police. Late in the evening on May 9, 1974, Janet was walking with fellow MOVE sister Leesing Africa to the corner store.  They were both pregnant at the time.  On their way to the store they were stopped and questioned by police officers who became abusive and slammed Janet stomach-first against a police car.  The two were subjected to a very rough handling and jailed overnight without food or water.  Both women lost their babies due to miscarriages.  MOVE immediately began demonstrating at the 18th District police station where the incident occurred.Legal CaseJanet was sentenced to 30 years in prison for 3rd degree murder.  This is despite the fact that nine people all killing one police officer with a single shot defies logic.  Also, the direction of the bullet into the officer’s head makes it impossible for it to have come from the MOVE house and police admitted that there was heavy police fire coming from several directions during the raid.Life in PrisonSoon before Janet was up for parole for the first time she found herself caught up in an attempted set up to deny Janet parole.  She was stopped by a male prison guard one day and he told her she needed to be searched.  She consented, but requested that a female officer conduct the procedure as it is against her religious beliefs to have a man feeling her body.  He agreed and called over a female guard, to which the female guard disagreed saying “she’s nothing special” and insisting instead that she be put in the hole for misconduct.  This, despite the fact that it is in fact prison policy for female prisoners to be able to request that female guards conduct searches.Janet, along with the other members of the MOVE 9 have been repeatedly denied parole, despite having served over 30 years for a crime they did not commit.SupportWebsitesOfficial MOVE SiteMOVE Parole BlogSupport StatementsHuman Rights Coalition Parole Support LetterHoward Zinn Letter of Support MediaMumia Abu-Jamal Audio Commentary on Janet’s Harrassment by Prison GuardsJanet Africa speaking out against Philly Police Chief Rizzo’s harassment of MOVE ","Yes","Pennsylvania","SCI Cambridge Springs","United States","","Janet","Holloway Africa #OO-6308","Cambridge Springs","16403-1238","","","","451 Fullerton Ave.","MOVE","https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=OsY67-c7W17dfgK0sCS90NoWOBJ3EI3wRGYusn9oMHMq2a74NT_yn5Akxyq&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d5c97cbf3d75cb63effe5661cdf3adb6d","","","Imprisoned","onamovellja@aol.com","https://www.facebook.com/pages/Free-the-MOVE-9/435412386474163","","Thursday, July 7, 2016 - 13:45"
"Janine Phillips Africa","","Apr 25, 1956","","Move 9","Janine Africa served as Minister of Education for the MOVE Organization. Her daugher, Life Africa, was killed at three weeks old by the Philadelphia police.  She was later caught in the police raid of the MOVE house where she and eight others were wrongfully convicted of the murder of a police officer who was killed by friendly fire during the raid.  She has served over 30 years in prison despite her innocence.  Learn more about the MOVE 9 and what you can do to help free Janine at MOVE 9 Parole.Personal BackgroundJanine had a baby and got married when she was just seventeen. She explains,“I didn’t know how to be a mother or a wife and trying to be both was driving me to a nervous breakdown. I developed a condition where my throat would close up on me and I couldn’t eat. I went from doctor to doctor, hospital to hospital and none of them could do anything for me.”One day she happened to pass by a demonstration MOVE was holding. She stopped and listened to what they had to say and she was impresed by the “strength, confidence and assertiveness of the MOVE women.”  Afterwards, she approached some of the MOVE women to find out more.She attended the next weekly study session they held and from then on was convinced of MOVE’s message and politics. She joined MOVE in 1973.After joining MOVE and living out their holistic and natural principles the condition with her throat was cured.  She also felt more confident as a mother and wife.Life Africa Tragically Killed by PoliceLocal politicians are shown the body of Life Africa, April 2, 1976Janine gave birth naturally at home to Life Africa on March 8, 1976.  Three weeks later, seven MOVE members were returning from a stint in jail.  Officers in at least ten cars pulled up to the house claiming that MOVE was creating a disturbance.  Chuck Africa told the officers to leave them alone and was then grabbed and beaten, setting off other officers to beat the other six MOVE men. Janine Africa was trying to protect her husband Phil Africa, when she was grabbed by a cop, thrown to the ground with 3-week-old Life Africa in arms, and stomped until she was nearly unconscious.  The baby’s skull was crushed.MOVE held a press conference the following day, explaining how the police had murdered Life and displayed a nightstick that was broken in two over Robert Africa’s head and an officer’s hat that was left at the house.  Because Life did not have birth certificate, the city denied the claim and so MOVE had to prove that Life was murdered by inviting local politicians over to view the body.Charges brought against the officers who murdered Life were immediately dismissed despite neighborhood witnesses.   The city instead pursued charges against the six men who were beaten that night.Legal Case1978 Stand-OffTensions reached a boiling point between MOVE and the Philadelphia police on August 8th, 1978.  Months prior the police had turned off the water to the house and set up a blockade preventing any food or aid to be sent in to the family.  After the MOVE family still refused to leave their home the city finally raided the house.  Police began firing on the house and in the flurry of bullets an officer went down.  Janine and eight others were falsely accused of the officer’s death.  All nine of them were convicted of third degree murder and received sentences from 30-100 years in prison.  Janine remains in prison to this day, denied parole every time she has come up for review.Life in PrisonA drawing by Janine’s husband, Phil Africa.Janine continues to struggle for a better world inside her cell.  She, along with her MOVE sisters have prevented prisoners from committing suicide, resolved racial disputes, and helped keep prisoners out of trouble so that they can get out on good behavior to reunite with their families again.SupportWebsitesOfficial MOVE SiteMOVE Parole BlogSupport StatementsHuman Rights Coalition Parole Support LetterHoward Zinn Letter of Support","Yes","Pennsylvania","SCI Cambridge Springs","United States","","Janine","Philips Africa #OO-6309","Cambridge Springs","16403-1238","","","","451 Fullerton Ave.","MOVE","https://www.paypal.com/us/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=OsY67-c7W17dfgK0sCS90NoWOBJ3EI3wRGYusn9oMHMq2a74NT_yn5Akxyq&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d5c97cbf3d75cb63effe5661cdf3adb6d","","","Imprisoned","onamovellja@aol.com","https://www.facebook.com/pages/Free-the-MOVE-9/435412386474163","","Thursday, July 7, 2016 - 13:45"
"Janye Waller","","","","","Janye is an outspoken young Black revolutionary from the San Francisco Bay Area. Janye was arrested in 2015 in an obvious case of racial profiling, in which the cops said he “fit the description” of a crime he did not commit. A witness to the “crime” immediately confirmed that Janye had nothing to do with it, but Janye was still taken into custody where he was questioned and then leveled with serious charges related to last year’s protests in Oakland against the non-indictments for the murders of Michael Brown and Eric Garner.  On May 12, 2016, he was sentenced to 2 years for incidents related to the Mike Brown and Eric Garner protests in 2014.  He will receive credit for time served pre-trial, until approximately May 2017.After several high profile police killings of young black men, the Bay Area, like much of the rest of the country, surged into a wave of protest and resistance. The state responded by using the legal system as a tool of repression, threatening incarceration and steep fines for some of those involved in these actions. It is sad but obvious that the one person getting targeted for that beautiful moment of protest is a strong and politicized young black man.  Acheter male extra et faites vous livrer en France","Yes","California","California Correctional Center","United States","","Janye","Waller #BA2719","Susanvile","96127","P.O.

He and his co-defendants were acquitted of many of the original charges, but convicted on lesser charges including misdemeanor mob action and possession of an incendiary device with intent to commit arson.He was scheduled to be released on parole in May 2016, however, in April 2016 he pleaded guilty to a charge stemming from an incident with Cook County Jail guards during his pre-trial confinement and was sentenced to an additional year.  His release date was extended to 6/6/19 presumably due to losing ""good time"" credit.  He likes receiving mail and books (off his Amazon Wishlist), but may not write back.Medical Condition:As of winter 2015, Jay is experiencing rapid progression of symptoms from Huntington’s Disease as he is being denied the recommended care for his condition.  His doctor’s testimony at sentencing for the NATO 3 charges revealed that Chase’s hereditary Huntington’s Disease is a likely factor contributing to his behavior. He has not been receiving the recommended medical care and nutritional supplements required to treat his condition while in custody, further adding to his deterioration as indicated by rapid weight loss.  In the past, he has gone on hunger strike as his only recourse to demand that they meet his medical and nutritional needs, without much success.  He wanted to adopt a vegan diet, but was told this would not be recommended for his medical condition.  Communicating with Jay has been difficult, in large part due to repression he is suffering on the inside. As such, we do not have a thorough up-to-date report on his well-being at this time.Gender Identity:In October of 2014, Chase wrote to several supporters, “I am a transgender woman,” asking to be referred to as Maya Chase. In accordance with these stated wishes, supporters spread the word in blogs and via social media that Chase’s preferred name was Maya and pronouns were feminine. In a more recent letter, however, dated September 21, 2015, Chase explicitly requested that his legal name and male pronouns be used once again to identify him: “Also let me apologize for rushing so much in my last letter [that] I didn’t get to explain the sudden change of names. After a lot of thinking I’ve decided even though I am Bi/TS/GQ, I don’t think I want to spend the rest of my life as a Woman 24/7. So you can refer to me in mascul[ine] terms.” Letters from that date forward have been signed using “Jared” or “Jay.” ","Yes","Illinois","Pontiac Correctional Facility","United States","","Jared","Chase M44710","Pontiac","61764","","","","P.O.

"Jock Palfreeman ","","Nov 13, 1986","","","Twenty one year old Australian Jock Palfreeman started his travels around Europe in early 2006. Having visited numerous countries and stayed in a small town an hour drive from Bulgaria’s capital, Sofia, living and working with his friends, he returned to visit them at the end of December 2007 after traveling to the UK.Legal CaseOn a night out with these friends that December, he witnessed a group of 16 football hooligans associated with various fascist groups attack two Roma (gypsy) boys, and he stepped in to defend them. He tried to keep them away by waving a knife at them, but they attacked him anyway, not only with fists and punches but also by throwing blocks of concrete at him. Jock defended himself with the knife. As a result of the fight, one of the attackers, Andrei Monov, died and another was seriously injured.The dead man turned out to be from a well known Bulgarian family with political connections and, after 2 long years of procedurally dubious trial with a clear political flavour, Jock was found guilty of murder and attempted murder, and sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and given a 375 000 Australian dollar fine. The case was built solely on the statements taken from the nazis, who claimed that Jock randomly attacked the group, chasing them with the intent to kill someone; whilst key witnesses and other possible witnesses were never interviewed and the CCTV footage from the scene mysteriously went missing.After numerous petitions submitted to the court by the defence, only one was accepted and this was merely to re-question five of the witnesses to explain why they all had initially stated that the fight between the group and the Roma boys actually taken place, but had then denied ever having said this. Despite the court now accepting that the fight between the group and Roma boys had actually taken place, the Appeal court upheld the original sentence.It is worth mentioning that despite the Bulgarian authorities trying to portray Jock's assailants as “normal students,” they had been members of, or had connections to, far right groups in Bulgaria. One of these “normal students,” Emil Alexiev, is a member of Bulgarian neo-Nazi group National Resistance and in 2010 had been arrested for taking part in a brutal attack against refugee rights activists on a tram, which left a number of them with very serious injuries.Life in PrisonIn prison, Jock never surrendered and quickly became a thorn in the side of the authorities, helping fellow prisoners by teaching English and acting as a jailhouse lawyer, as well as highlighting the authorities’ abuses and corruption. Additionally, he founded the Bulgarian Prisoners Association (BPA), the first official organisation to fight for rights of prisoners in Bulgaria.Due to Jock’s activist work as chairman of the BPA, helping fellow prisoners and giving legal advice, Jock has suffered numerous incidents of repression at the hands of prison authorities, such as frequent cell searches, periods in isolation, beatings, problems with receiving books and access to his studies.On January 13, 2013, Jock went on hunger strike and, after 30 days of drinking only watery drinks and losing 20 kg, he managed finally to get an official answer to the various requests that he had submitted to the prison authorities in connection with his mistreatment, and which had all been ignored, and he continues fighting his corner by the legal means open to him.Over a year ago the Australian government sent a request for Jock’s transfer to an Australian prison, which can only happen if Jock’s friends and family pay the price that the Bulgarian court ordered to be paid in compensation to his victims and their families. Jock has therefore been forced to conclude that he is currently being held for ransom by the Bulgarian judicial system.He can read English and Bulgarian.You can visit BPA website at: https://bulgarianprisonersassociation.wordpress.com/MediaSome archive info on support actions, Jock's letters etc: http://anarchistsolidarity.wordpress.com/category/jock-palfreeman/Good mainstream book about Jock by Belinda Hawkins: http://everyparentsnightmare.com/  ","Yes","","Sofia Central Prison","Bulgaria","","Jock","Palfreeman","Sofia","1309","","","","21 General Stoletov Boulevard","Anti-Fascist","https://www.paypal.com/au/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_flow&SESSION=grS7pcf__GwU_m1Iure3w17mOxuEEwAsc-fHhNNdKnCXm_cQV6Oa4tLIU2K&dispatch=5885d80a13c0db1f8e263663d3faee8d5c97cbf3d75cb63effe5661cdf3adb6d","","Tuesday, December 28, 2027","Imprisoned","freejock@live.com.au","https://www.facebook.com/WhoIsJockPalfreeman/","","Thursday, July 7, 2016 - 14:33"

Released in 1971, his outside activism was cut short a week following his release when Joe-Joe was confronted by an officer of the notoriously brutal Philadelphia police department. The police officer was killed in the confrontation, and Bowen fled. After his capture and incarceration, Bowen became a Black Liberation Army combatant, defiant to authorities at every turn.Warden AssassinationIn 1973, Bowen and Philadelphia Five prisoner Fred “Muhammad Kafi” Burton assassinated Holmesberg prison’s warden and deputy warden as well as wounded the guard commander in retaliation for intense repression against Muslim prisoners in the facility.Prison StandoffIn October 28, 1981 Joe-Joe led a mass liberation attempt from the state’s largest prison at Graterford, after arming other prisoners with two shotguns and two revolvers.  Bowen and three others attempted to scale the prison’s 40-foot wall and were stopped by a rifle shot from a guard tower.  After returning fire they captured three guards and retreated into the prison kitchen where they captured three kitchen employees and 29 inmates.  Three other inmates joined in the action.Bowen and the six others held off the prison’s guards, State Police and FBI for five days until an agreement was struck.  In the end, the men were charged with assault, attempted escape, kidnapping and one other offense.  Joe-Joe was sent to the Federal Prison in Marion, IL where he met up with other political prisoners and prisoners of war such as Sundiata Acoli, Hanif Shabazz Bey and Ray Luc Levasseur.Life in PrisonMuch of Joe-Joe’s time in prison has been spent in and out of control units, solitary confinement and other means of being isolated from the general prison population. However, he is legendary to many prisoners as a revolutionary. ""I used to teach the brothers how to turn their rage into energy and understand their situations,"" Bowen told the Philadelphia Inquirer in 1981. ""I don't threaten anybody. I don't talk to the pigs. I don't drink anything I can't see through and I don't eat anything that comes off a tray. When the time comes, I'll be ready."" He is currently being kept in the control unit at the State Correctional Institution at Coal Township, with no prospects of ever being released into general population.During his time in prison he has raised the consciousness of thousands of Pennsylvania prisoners through his powerful history and political/military education classes.  Many of these prisoners become aware of his story just by arriving at Curran-Fromhold Correctional Facility, named after the warden and deputy killed in 1973. ","No","Pennsylvania","SCI Coal Township","United States","","Joseph","Bowen #AM-4272","Coal Township","17866-1021","","","","1 Kelley Drive","Black/New Afrikan Liberation","","","","Imprisoned","","","","Friday, June 16, 2017 - 18:34"

"Kamau Sadiki (Freddie Hilton)","","Feb 19, 1953","","","Kamau Sadiki is a former member of the Black Panther Party and was convicted of a 30-year old murder case of a Fulton County Police Officer found shot to death in his car outside a service station. Personal BackgroundAt the age of 17, Kamau dedicated his life to the service of his people. He worked out of the Jamaica office of the Black Panther Party.  A rank and file party member, Kamau worked in the Free Breakfast Program each morning and then went out into the community to sell the BPP newspaper later in the day. While selling his papers he continued to educate the people, while organizing tenants, welfare mothers, whomever he came in contact with. At the end of the day, he reported to the office. He wrote his daily report and attended political education classes.At nineteen Kamau was a member of the Black Liberation Army (BLA).  Several members of the BLA, including Kamau, left New York City and lived in the Atlanta area for a short period of time.Legal CaseOn November 3, 1971 Atlanta Police Officer James Green was murdered. On the night of the murder, two witnesses observed three black males run from a van where Officer Green sat at a gas station in downtown Atlanta. The witnesses failed to identify Kamau from a photographic line-up.  There was no physical evidence that implicated Mr. Sadiki. In 1971, the Atlanta police department closed the case as unsolved.In 1999, the FBI in pursuit of collaboration in their attempts to recapture Assata Shakur, a political exile in Cuba, threatened Sadiki with life in prison if he did not assist them. When Sadiki did not comply, the FBI convinced Atlanta police to re-open the case and charge Sadiki.In 2001, a former BLA member gave a statement about the 1971 murder after being detained during a traffic stop.  With no eyewitness testimony and no physical evidence, the State based its case entirely upon the statements of three former BLA members who were present in Atlanta at the time of Officer Green’s murder.  Kamau was arrested in 2002 in Brooklyn, New York some thirty one (31) years later after the murder.On November 10, 2003, Judge Stephanie Manis sentenced Kamau Sadiki to life imprisonment for murder and ten (10) years to run consecutively for armed robbery after a Fulton County Superior Court jury found him guilty for the murder of Atlanta Police Officer James Green on November 3, 1971.Justice Denied at TrialIn addition to the lack of any physical evidence that Kamau murdered Officer Green, BLA member John Tomas’ former wife’s testimony was excluded from the trial. Her testimony would have included two conversations where others admitted their participation in the murder of the officer. Mr. Thomas who is now deceased, made statements exonerating Kamau and stated that he had nothing to do with the shooting. Judge Manis ruled such testimony by Ms. Thomas inadmissible and excluded the testimony from the jury’s consideration. Judge Manis also included a conspiracy charge to the jury when there was no evidence of such and Judge Manis’ admission into evidence inflammatory statements regarding Mr. Sadiki’s participation in the BLA and allegations of misdeeds by the BLA.","Yes","Georgia","Augusta State Medical Prison","United States","","Freddie","Hilton #0001150688","Grovetown","30813","3001 Gordon Highway","","","Bldg 13A-2 E7","Black/New Afrikan Liberation","","Augusta State Medical Prison","","Imprisoned","info@freekamau.org","","","Friday, April 15, 2016 - 08:08"

"Leonard Peltier","","Sep 12, 1944","","","Leonard Peltier (born September 12, 1944) is a Native American activist and member of the American Indian Movement (AIM). In 1977 he was convicted and sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment for first degree murder in the shooting of two FBI agents during a 1975 conflict on the Pine Ridge indian Reservation.Peltier's indictment and conviction have been the subject of much controversy; Amnesty International placed his case under the ""Unfair Trials"" category of its Annual Report: USA 2010  The ShootoutOn June 26, 1975, two agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)—Mr. Jack Coler and Mr. Ron Williams—entered private property on the Pine Ridge reservation, the Jumping Bull Ranch. They drove unmarked vehicles, wore plain clothes, and neglected to identify themselves as law enforcement officers. They allegedly sought to arrest a young Indian man, Jimmy Eagle, for the theft of a pair of cowboy boots. They believed, the government contends, that they had seen Eagle in a red pick up truck that they then followed onto the Jumping Bull property. Members of the American Indian Movement (AIM) were camping on the property at the time. They had been invited there by the Jumping Bull elders, who sought protection from the extreme violence on the reservation at that time. Many non-AIM persons were present as well.Map of the Jumping Bull PropertyFor unknown reasons, a shoot-out began. A family with small children was trapped in the cross fire. Throughout the ranch, people screamed that they were under attack and many of the men present hurried to return fire. The Cost When the skirmish ended, the two FBI agents were dead. The U.S. government claims they had been wounded and then shot through their heads at close range.Joe StuntzA young Native American named Joe Stuntz (above) also lay dead, shot through the head by a sniper bullet. His killing has never been investigated. The more than 30 men, women, and children present on the ranch were then quickly surrounded by over 150 FBI agents, Special Weapons and Tactics (or SWAT) team members, Bureau of Indian Affairs police, and local vigilantes. They barely escaped through a hail of bullets.The AftermathThe FBI immediately began its investigation into the shoot-out, the so-called RESMURS investigation, and launched the biggest manhunt of its history.Angry agents shot up the Jumping Bull home, leaving bullet riddled family portraits in their wake. In the days following the shoot-out, FBI agents in SWAT gear and carrying assault rifles also terrorized other Pine Ridge residents through a series of warrantless no-knock assaults on their homes.Continuing with its long tradition of manipulating the media—placing articles in the popular press that put the Bureau in a positive light and interfering in the publication of “dissident” writings by persons such as Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.—the FBI immediately set about disseminating gross inaccuracies about this case. Agents Coler and Williams, the FBI claimed, had been murdered in “a cold-blooded ambush” by a large force of trained guerillas in “sophisticated bunkers” and “fortifications,” but not before Williams had first pleaded for their lives for the sake of Coler’s wife and children. How the Bureau developed this information about Williams’ last words in the absence of anyone who could have heard them was unclear. Other reports indicated that the agents’ bodies had been “riddled with bullets.” Then FBI director Clarence Kelley was forced to retract these statements when reporters—who had been barred from the Jumping Bull property for two days following the shoot-out—began to discover the truth.*Selective ProsecutionThe FBI very quickly focused its investigation on prominent AIM members known to be present during the shoot-out—Leonard Peltier, in particular. The investigation became a race to develop a case against him.Investigators imposed their desires on the evidence, taking bits and pieces and fashioning them in such a way so as to support their case. In short order, indictments were issued against Leonard Peltier, as well as his two friends and colleagues Dino Butler and Bob Robideau, who also had been present throughout the incident. Charges against a fourth man, Jimmy Eagle (a non-AIM member), were later dropped. (Prosecutors admitted during Peltier’s trial that Jimmy Eagle had not even been on the reservation on the day of the shoot-out. However, FBI documents later revealed that the government decided to dismiss charges against Eagle so that “the full prosecutive weight of the Federal Government could be directed against Leonard Peltier.”).Despite the presence of so many other individuals on the Jumping Bull property during the shoot-out, no other individuals were given any serious scrutiny during the RESMURS investigation—even those who claimed participation in the shoot-out and bragged about being responsible for the agents’ deaths. No other persons were charged for the shooting deaths of the FBI agents. The Butler-Robideau TrialDarrelle “Dino” Butler and Bob Robideau stood trial separately from Leonard Peltier who, convinced he would never receive a fair trial in the United States, had fled to Canada.The defense team succeeded in getting the trial moved from racist South Dakota to Cedar Rapids, Iowa. Cedar Rapids was, however, a predominantly white city and concerns remained as to the likelihood of Butler and Robideau receiving a fair trial.Immediately, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) began setting the stage for the defendants’ convictions. Agents warned local police that carloads of American Indian Movement (AIM) “terrorists” were descending on the town. On May 11,1976, U.S. marshals visited every office in the Federal Building (where the trial was to be held), telling folks to prepare for shooting incidents and the seizure of hostages and advising them that marshals on the roof would be on the lookout for marauding Indians.Elsewhere, rumors about alleged renegade activity ran rampant. A report allegedly emanating from Connecticut police intelligence, for example, stated that a “terrorist” group affiliated with AIM had hatched a plan “to kill a cop a day.” The report failed to mention that the organization referenced was defunct.On June 22, the FBI released a teletype that was distributed to law enforcement agencies throughout the country. It claimed that 2,000 AIM “Dog Soldiers” trained in “the Northwest Territory” would fan out across South Dakota and would kidnap, bomb, burn, snipe… all to disrupt the Bicentennial Celebration.When the 2,000 “Dog Soldiers” didn’t show up in South Dakota and the rest of the FBI’s scare campaign was shown to be a lie, the Cedar Rapids community began to look at AIM members, who had peaceably assembled there for the trial, with a fresh eye and view the government’s machinations with skepticism.Evidence HeardPresided over by Judge Edward McManus, the trial commenced on June 7, 1976.The defendants admitted that they were present at the shoot-out and had exchanged fire with the FBI agents in the course of defending their women and children.In a search for the truth, Judge McManus allowed a broad range of evidence to be heard, often over the vigorous objections of the prosecutor. This allowed the jury to receive a full explanation of how the shoot-out had occurred and why the Native defendants reacted as they did.Testimony was heard about the Pine Ridge “Reign of Terror” and from the director of the FBI himself, Clarence Kelley, on the Bureau’s counterintelligence activities and tactics. Testimony prompted by the defense attorneys also brought forward a pattern of FBI misconduct in other prosecutions of AIM members, specifically those occurring after the AIM occupation of Wounded Knee in 1973.During the trial, a key prosecution witness, Mr. Draper, also admitted that he had been threatened by the FBI and as a result had changed his testimony based on agents’ instructions, so as to support the government’s position. Another prosecution witness also was shown to have lied on the witness stand.The VerdictClearly, the evidence heard at trial was sufficient to convince the jury of the defendants’ claims. Further, the government’s behavior before and during the trail severely damaged its credibility. In July, the jurors found that there was no evidence to link Butler and Robideau to the fatal shots. Moreover, the exchange of gun fire from a distance was deemed an act of self-defense. ExtraditionMr. Leonard Peltier was arrested in Canada on February 6,1976. He was extradited from Canada in December of the same year on the basis of a false affidavit signed by Myrtle Poor Bear, a Native American woman known to have serious mental health problems.In fact, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) produced more than one false affidavit.Affidavit 1, dated February 19, 1976. Here, Special Agents David Price and William Wood had Myrtle Poor Bear recount how it was she who overheard the planning of the Northwest AIM group to lure Special Agents Coler and Williams to their deaths in an ambush. There was no claim Poor Bear witnessed the shoot-out, but that she heard Leonard Peltier order the agents killed beforehand, and that he later “confessed to her.”Affidavit 2, dated February 23, 1976. With this affidavit, Price and Wood had Poor Bear present herself as being Peltier’s “girl friend,” and as overhearing planning for an ambush. However, with this affidavit, Poor Bear was presented as having witnessed Peltier killing the agents. Details on an escape route apparently were designed to explain away the Bureau’s embarrassing inability to apprehend suspects at the scene of the shoot-out. The method of killing coincidentally corresponded to the FBI’s contrived “execution” scenario.Affidavit 3, dated March 31, 1976 . This affidavit was eventually submitted to the Canadian courts. Here, the agents totally abandoned the notion of Poor Bear’s having overheard planning for an ambush. Instead they have her provide considerable detail as an “eyewitness.” Any alleged confession on the part of Leonard Peltier was not included.Government AdmissionLeonard Peltier was extradited from Canada to the United States. Today, the government concedes that, in fact, Myrtle Poor Bear did not know Leonard Peltier, nor was she present at the time of the shooting. She later confessed she had given false statements after being pressured and terrorized by FBI agents. Myrtle Poor Bear sought to testify in this regard at Leonard Peltier’s trial. However, the judge barred her testimony on the grounds of mental incompetence. In addition to being a violation of Leonard Peltier’s rights, the United States government committed fraud on the court during the extradition proceedings and violated the sovereignty of Canada. The U.S. government has made no attempt to correct this wrong and, to date, the illegal extradition has not been corrected by the Canadian Court. The Peltier TrialIn March 1977, Leonard Peltier stood trial in Fargo, North Dakota. According to the government, the case was originally assigned to the federal district court in Sioux Falls, where Judge Nichol (who had spoken out against government and FBI misconduct during proseutions arising from the 1973 siege of Wounded Knee) would have presided. When Nichol excused himself, the case was assigned to Judge Paul Benson who removed the trial to Fargo.It should be noted that, in December 1982, attorney William Kunstler discovered in a telephone conversation with Judge Edward McManus (who had presided over the Butler/Robideau trial) that McManus, not Benson, had been scheduled to try the Peltier case. He had been astonished, he said, to find himself arbitrarily removed in favor of Judge Benson. To this day, it is not clear how McManus’ removal was accomplished or by whom specifically. There appears to have been a concerted effort, however, to prevent the involvement of judges in Peltier’s trial who had previously made rulings in favor of defendants in the government’s prosecutions of other members of the American Indian Movement (AIM).The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), as it had done during the Butler/Robideau trial, spread rumors about anticipated “terrorist” attacks by AIM members that built tensions in an already anti-Indian environment.It was later discovered that the FBI met secretly with Judge Benson prior to trial. There are no notes of these meetings but, not surprisingly, Judge Benson’s subsequent rulings were made almost always in favor of the prosecution.Documents discovered after the trial also revealed that the FBI had informants in the Wounded Knee Legal Defense/Offense Committee at or about the time of Leonard’s capture (a critical time, i.e., while a defense was being mounted).* The government has refused to divulge the identities of the informants. Infiltration of the defense team would have meant that the prosecution received first-hand information concerning the defense, a clear violation of Leonard’s constitutional rights.Jury selection, completed in only one day, resulted in an all white jury of ten women and four men, two of whom were alternates. They were sequestered for the duration of the trial. Never in any danger, they nevertheless were made to feel vulnerable to attack. They were transported to the court house in a bus where the windows had been taped over and escorted by Special Weapons And Tactics (SWAT) team members at all times.The government presented fifteen days of evidence to the jury after which the defense presented six days of evidence. However, due to frequent rulings in the prosecution’s favor, the jury actually heard only two and one-half days of the defense case.On April 19, 1977, after 11 hours of deliberation, the jury returned a verdict of guilty.What became evident much later is that the government committed fraud on the court and violated Leonard’s constitutional right to a fair trial by withholding evidence, presenting false evidence, and intimidating witnesses into committing perjury.Ballistics EvidenceCritical ballistics evidence that reflected Leonard Peltier’s innocence was withheld during his trial. Specifically, the ballistics expert for the FBI, Evan Hodge, testified that he had been unable to perform the best test, a firing pin test, on certain casings found near Agent Coler’s car because the rifle in question had been damaged in a fire. Instead, he stated that he had conducted an extractor mark test and found the casing and weapon to match.Years later, documents obtained through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) showed that, in October 1975, a firing pin ballistics test had indeed been performed on the rifle and that the results were clearly negative. In short, the fatal bullets did not come from the weapon alleged to have been fired by Leonard Peltier. It should also be made very clear that the AR-15 and FBI-issued M-16 deliver the same .223 caliber round. However, the jury never heard about any of these crucial issues.MoreOn a related matter, SA Fred Coward testified that he was able to see Peltier at the site of the shoot-out, some 700 feet away, using the telescopic lens on his rifle. The defense attorneys duplicated this sighting and found it to be impossible. However, Judge Benson would not allow a test of the claim in court. Coward’s testimony was allowed into evidence and used as a basis to support Peltier’s conviction.The Pickup TruckEqually disturbing are the numerous discrepancies regarding the key vehicle in the case. Agents Williams and Coler had radioed that they were chasing a “red pick up truck” which they believed was transporting a suspect. The chase led to the Jumping Bull Ranch and the fatal shoot-out. At trial, however, the evidence had changed to describe a “red and white van,” quite a different vehicle and which, not coincidentally, was more easily linked to Leonard Peltier.WitnessesNo known witnesses exist as to the actual shooting of FBI Agents Coler and Williams. Three adolescents gave inconclusive and vague testimonies at Peltier’s trial, contradicting their own earlier statements, as well as each other. All three witnesses admitted they had been seriously threatened and intimidated by FBI agents.The court, at Leonard Peltier’s trial, did not permit the jury to learn of the FBI’s pattern and practice of using false affidavits and intimidating witnesses in recent related cases against other members of the American Indian Movement. The jury was thus unable to properly evaluate the credibility of prosecution witnesses’ testimony.The Prosecution’s CaseThere was no witness testimony that Leonard Peltier shot the two FBI agents.There was no witness testimony that placed Leonard Peltier near the scene before the agents’ deaths occurred. Those witnesses placing Peltier, Robideau, and Butler near the scene after the killing were coerced and intimidated by the FBI.There was no forensic evidence as to the exact type of rifle that caused the fatal injuries of the agents. Several different weapons present in the area during the shoot-out— evidence now shows that there were other AR-15 rifles in the area—could have caused the fatal injuries. In addition, the AR-15 rifle claimed to be Leonard Peltier’s weapon was found to be incompatible with the bullet casing allegedly found near Agent Coler’s car (according to the FBI’s documents, by two different agents on two different days). Although other bullets were fired at the crime scene, no other casings or evidence about them were offered by the prosecutor in this case.In short, there was/is no reasonable evidence that Leonard Peltier committed the crimes for which he was convicted. Instead there is very strong evidence of FBI and prosecutorial misconduct.Comparison of the Two TrialsBy 1977, Leonard Peltier was the only remaining individual the FBI could blame for the deaths of the two agents. The charges against Jimmy Eagle had been dropped—the government stipulated that he was not on the reservation on the day of the firefight. (However, FBI documents later revealed that the government decided to dismiss charges against Eagle so that “the full prosecutive weight of the Federal Government could be directed against Leonard Peltier.”) Dino Butler and Bob Robideau were acquitted in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, in July 1976.The Butler/Robideau trial had uncovered much FBI misconduct, such as tampering with witnesses and evidence, perjury, counterintelligence-type activities and tactics used against AIM, and substantial evidence indicating there was a full scale paramilitary assault on Pine Ridge by the FBI and other law enforcement officials on the day in question. The jury as a result concluded that Butler and Robideau were acting in self-defense.Peltier’s defense team had this same evidence and more. Yet they would never be be able to present a major portion of it to the jury.The government clearly was determined to convict Peltier and succeeded. Leonard Peltier was found guilty not because he was guilty, but because crucial aspects of his trial were manipulated to favor the prosecution and, consequently, cause a conviction. After The TrialThe only evidence against Leonard Peltier was the fact that he was present at the Jumping Bull ranch during the fatal shoot-out. There were more than 30 other individuals there on the day of the shooting—members and nonmembers of the American Indian Movement (AIM)—but only AIM members were prosecuted. Leonard Peltier is the only person who was convicted, sentenced, and imprisoned. And, today, the U.S. Attorney admits that no one knows who fired the fatal shots.Post-Trial Admissions At the Peltier trial, the prosecutor claimed in summation that “… we proved that he went down to the bodies and executed those two young men at point blank range…” At one appellate hearing, however, the government attorney conceded,“We had a murder, we had numerous shooters, we do not know who specifically fired what killing shots… we do not know, quote-unquote, who shot the agents.”At Peltier’s trial the prosecutor, referring to the weapon alleged to have been used in the killings of the agents, stated that, “There is only one AR-15 in the group. There is no testimony concerning any other AR-15 at Tent City or at the crime scene or anywhere else in the area…” Leonard Peltier’s lawyers later filed a Habeas Corpus petition claiming that the government had misled the jury by concealing evidence of the presence of other AR-15 rifles, and thus other potential weapons used in the killings of the agents, at the scene of the incident. The same prosecuting attorney, before the Eighth Circuit Court in 1992, claimed that “… I think it’s simply a misstatement of the trial that there was no evidence presented and it was suppressed as to other AR-15s at the scene…”  ","Yes","Florida","USP Coleman I","United States","","Leonard","Peltier #89637-132","Coleman","33521","","","","P.O.

"Marius Mason","http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/20H9JWR4VGXTS/ref=cm_sw_su_w","Jan 25, 1962","","","Personal BackgroundMarius Mason is a loving parent of two. He lived and worked in the Detroit area for most of his life. Like the late Earth First! (EF!) organizer, Judi Bari, he was part of a generation of radicals who worked to link the environmental and labor movements, and was jointly active in both EF! and the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). It was this alliance which led to the initial success of the anti-globalization movement such as at the 1999 anti-WTO demonstration in Seattle. Mason was an editor of the Industrial Worker, the IWW newspaper, and a musician who recorded a neo-folk album, Not For Profit, with fellow EF!er Darryl Cherney in 1999. He also worked with numerous political as well as traditional charity groups.In addition to his work with the IWW and Earth First!, he is also an avid community gardener, a musician, a writer, and a volunteer for a free herbal healthcare collective. He also was an extended care assistant at a small Cincinnati school when he was arrested on March 10, 2008 by federal agents.He has been charged with involvement with a December,1999 arson at a Michigan State University genetics laboratory at Agriculture Hall and a January, 2000 arson of logging equipment in Mesick, Michigan. Both arsons were claimed by the Earth Liberation Front.Legal CaseGovernment Monitors and Harasses MariusIn the years preceding Marius’s’s arrest, he and his partner at the time, Frank Ambrose, had been questioned multiple times by authorities, summoned to grand juries, and forced to surrender DNA evidence; at one point authorities attempted to affix a GPS tracking unit to Mason’s car.Partner Turns InformantIn early 2007, Frank Ambrose became an informant with the FBI.  He began traveling throughout the Midwest spying on activists and tape recording their conversations with a concealed wire.  He filed for a divorce the day Marius was arrested.  He even tried to entrap other activists with emails he circulated and has now offered to give workshops to law enforcement on topics such as the Earth Liberation Front and security culture.  He was released from prison in 2015, after serving only 6 years.Green ScareMarius is currently serving the longest sentence of any environmental activist in the US.  His charges are part of the Green Scare, a trend by the government of labeling environmental direct action as “eco-terrorism” despite the acts ensuring that no life, human or otherwise, is being harmed. In addition to labeling environmental activists both publicly and legally as “terrorists,” the government also charges activists with inflated sentences. In Marius’s case, he was facing a life sentence. He decided to plea guilty and is now serving nearly 22 years in prison.Plea AgreementUnlike many Green Scare arrestees, Marius was never given the option of a full non-cooperating plea agreement by the government, which would have allowed him to plea guilty without implicating others.  Instead he faced either the original life sentence or a reduced sentence on the condition that he confirm statements that his partner turned FBI informant, Frank Ambrose, had already stated.Because he would not be offering any new evidence implicating other activists, Marius decided to take the plea.Mason eventually admitted to committing 14 acts of property destruction together. One of these actions, an attempt to destroy the Nestle-owned Ice Mountain bottled water pumping station, had always been denied by Mason, and activists close to him speculate that he was forced to accept guilt for it in order to accept the plea bargain. (It is a common police tactic to force defendants to accept blame for unsolved crimes in order to close investigations.)Marius’s SentenceMason accepted a plea bargain for 15–20 years, but Chief US District Judge Paul L. Maloney sentenced him to 21 years and 10 months and ordered restitution of $4.1 million to the sites damaged by his acts. Part of Mason’s plea agreement stipulated that he had to accept the so-called Terrorism Enhancement designation, which provided for broad discretion in sentencing. (Before the sentencing, people close to Mason speculated that he might receive as long as 30 years.) The judge was able to consider the 12 other actions Mason admitted to (but was not being charged with) for the purpose of his sentencing.SupportFree Marius MasonMediaMarius’s Sentencing Statement (February 5, 2009)Poetry and Artwork by Marius Mason","Yes","Texas","FMC Carswell","United States","","M.","Mason #04672-061","Fort Worth","76127","","","","P.O.

"Matthew DeHart","","Jun 11, 1984","1DEharT171Hgc8vQs1TJvEotVcHz7QLSQg","","Matt is a former US Air National Guard drone team member and alleged WikiLeaks courier who worked with the hactivist group Anonymous. After becoming the subject of a national security investigation — and allegations relating to a teenage pornography case which he vehemently denies — he fled from the United States to Canada with his family to seek political asylum and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. In what represents a moral victory for the DeHart family, the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board judge found that the teenage pornography case against Matt lacked credibility. However, because the IRB considered that the United States still had a functioning democracy, they denied his claim, and on 1 March, 2015 Matt DeHart was handed over into US federal custody.While serving with the US Air National Guard, Matt DeHart had become disillusioned with post-9/11 America when he realized that the CIA knew it was killing children and innocents. A longtime member of Anonymous, in mid-September 2009, he found an unprotected file, an FBI investigation into the CIA, on The Shell, a server he ran. He deleted the file but it later reappeared in encrypted form on another server he had access to, and was destined for WikiLeaks. Matt was honourably discharged from the military when, ostensibly, the Air National Guard deemed that his depression was incompatible with his work. However, he believes the Air National Guard knew about his online activity. “Part of my job with Anonymous was I helped people communicate securely,” he said. “I would protect people from NSA spying.”The FBI raided the DeHart family home on 25 Jan 2010 and seized Matt’s computer together with every data storage device in the house — except for two hidden thumb drives, which he says contain Anonymous contact information, server logs from The Shell and leaked documents. Later that year, DeHart was detained at the border when returning from college in Canada. There, Matt says he was tortured and intravenously drugged against his will. FBI records of his interrogation confirm that Matt was detained for “national security” reasons and questioned about his military unit, Anonymous, WikiLeaks and espionage. During his interrogation, he was presented with a Criminal Complaint and Arrest Warrant for the solicitation of child pornography that had been filed in the afternoon after his morning detention at the border. According to Matt, the FBI told him they knew he was innocent of the charges.Matt spent almost the next two years in various US jails while awaiting trial for the pornography charges. In 2012 a US judge, after reviewing classified FBI reports, expressed skepticism in open court over the government’s charges against Matt, and ordered that he be released on bond. Matt then returned to Canada with his parents to seek asylum, but he again found himself in detention, and under questioning by the Canadian Security and Intelligence Service (CSIS) and the Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) Intelligence and War Crimes Division. In February 2015 Canada denied Matt DeHart’s request for asylum, and on March 1, 2015 he was deported back to the US, where he is currently in federal custody.In 2016, he was sentenced to seven and a half years in jail today in Nashville, TN, in accordance with the plea deal he was coerced into the previous year after being threatened with up to 50 years in prison. Matt has already served three and a half years in prison.  He plead guilty to receiving teen ‘pornography,’ consisting of messages dated from 2008 that the US government decided to charge years later. The charging decision only came after the government became aware that Matt was a WikiLeaks and Anonymous supporter, and that Matt had discovered sensitive military files, allegedly destined for WikiLeaks, had been uploaded to a server he ran.  In addition to prison time, Matt will be subject to thirteen years of post-release supervision, with likely restrictions on his computer access.  ","Yes","Kentucky","FCI Ashland","United States","","Matthew","Paul DeHart #06813-036","Ashland","41105","","","","P.O.

"Michael ""Mike"" Davis Africa","","Oct 06, 1955","","Move 9","I am MOVE’s Minister of Confrontation. I was born and raised in West Philly, youngest of eight children, raised in an environment of poverty, gang war, and all the other afflictions of ghetto life. I started drinking at an early age to hang out with the crowd and eventually ventured over to drugs. I joined the Marines at age 16 to try to stem that spiral, but it definitely made things worse. I wasn’t socially conscious about many issues and didn’t really care to be. My whole life basically centered around locatin the next happening party.I was introduced to some MOVE members by my wife’s family, MOVE members had come to aid them during a neighborhood dispute. I later saw some of those same MOVE people demonstrating against the 16th Police District, a notoriously racist gang known for terrorizing the community where I grew up. The same 16th District that had members of the Black Panthers stip buck naked in front of their HQ, including pregnant women in the early 1970’s. Most people I knew hated them, we just feared them more, so while I wasn’t immediately attracted to MOVE, I was immediately amazed by their courage. I had never seen people confront the cops the way MOVE did – directly, forcefully and never taking a step back.In 1974 I attended a demonstration where MOVE was protesting the jailing of 2 or their younger members, ages 13 and 15. A judge had them thrown in jail for speaking out against them. The police arrested us all, literally, as we got off the bus, and jailed us on a whole slew of charges. It really scared the hell our of me, but it also let me see more clearly what MOVE was saying about the system.From that moment on, I listened more carefully to the Teachings of JOHN AFRICA. I became more attracted to the strength it took to confront the system as MOVE did. And as I read more of the Guidelines written by JOHN AFRICA I did become motivated for the first time in my life by something other then diversions, drugs, and parties. The more I engaged in MOVE activity, the less I engaged in that other stuff. In the first couple years being around MOVE I went from being a young chain smoking, pill popping alcoholic, completely apathetic to the problems of virtually everybody, to doing none of those things and being motivated to become a strong revolutionary soldier because of the example I say being demonstrated by JOHN AFRICA.LONG LIVE JOHN AFRICA!

"Mutulu Shakur, Dr.","","Aug 08, 1950","","","Early Life:Mutulu Shakur was born on August 8, 1950, in Baltimore, Maryland as Jeral Wayne Williams. At age seven he moved to Jamaica, Queens, New York City with his mother and younger sister. Shakur’s political and social consciousness began to develop early in his life. His mother suffered not only from being Black and female, but was also blind. These elements constituted Shakur’s first confrontation with the state, while assisting his mother to negotiate through the maze that made up the social service system. Through this experience, Shakur learned that the system did not operate in the interests of Black people and that Black people must control the institutions that affect their lives.Political Life:Since the age 16, Dr. Shakur has been a part of the New Afrikan Independence Movement. As a part of this movement Dr. Shakur has been a target of the illegal Counterintelligence Program carried out by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (COINTELPRO). This was a secret police strategy used in the U.S. starting in the 1960′s to destroy and neutralize progressive and revolutionary organizations. It is believed that Dr. Shakur’s resistance to this program led to his arrest and trial.During the late sixties, Dr. Shakur was politically active and worked with the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM), a Black Nationalist group which struggled for Black self-determination and socialist change in America. He was also a member of the Provisional Government of the Republic of New Afrika which endorsed the founding of an independent New Afrikan (Black) Republic and the establishment of an independent Black state in the southern U.S. Dr. Shakur also worked very closely with the Black Panther Party, supporting his brother Lumumba Shakur and Zayd.Healthcare Activism:In 1970, Shakur was asked to teach political education to clients of the Lincoln Hospital Detoxification Program. This program was founded by Black and Latino revolutionary youth in the South Bronx, NY. Shortly after starting there, two of his children were badly injured in an auto accident. Looking for alternative treatment, he approached activists of the I Wor Kuen, a revolutionary Chinese organization, that ran a health service for the older Chinese community. An Asian woman who was an acupuncturist cured his children using traditional Chinese Medicine. Discussions with the Chinese and sessions with addicts at Lincoln Detox showed Shakur similarities between the struggles of China against opium addiction which had been brought there by the British colonizers and the struggles in the Black community against the genocidal drug traffic recently revealed to have been orchestrated by the US Central intelligence Agency (CIA).Shakur attended the Quebec Acupuncture Association where he obtained a Doctorate in Acupuncture. He used his skills to treat narcotics addiction and eventually became Director of the Lincoln Detox Acupuncture Research Unit.After losing a legal battle with the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation over the control of the Lincoln Hospital Detoxification Program, Dr. Shakur and several other acupuncturists were transferred out of the program in 1978. As is true with many programs and ideas developed by young revolutionaries, the treatment of addiction with acupuncture continues at several public hospital sites in New York City but the names of the pioneers are not mentioned in the official history.From 1978 to 1982, Dr. Shakur was the Co-Founder and Co-Director of the Black Acupuncture Advisory Association of North America (BAAANA) and the Harlem Institute of Acupuncture. Where, at Lincoln, Dr. Shakur had managed a detox program recognized as the largest and most effective of its kind by the National Institute of Drug Abuse, National Acupuncture Research Society and the World Academic Society of Acupuncture, at BAAANA he continued his remarkable work and also treated thousands of poor and elderly patients who would otherwise have no access to treatment of this type. Many community leaders, political activists, lawyers and doctors were served by BAAANA and over one hundred medical students were trained in the discipline of acupuncture.By the late 1970′s Dr. Shakur’s work in acupuncture and drug detoxification was both nationally and internationally known and he was invited to address members of the medical community around the world. Dr. Shakur lectured on his work at many medical conferences, and was invited to the People’s Republic of China. In addition in his work for the Charles Cobb Commission for Racial Justice for the National Council of Churches, he developed their anti-drug program.Legal Case:In March 1982, Dr. Shakur and 10 others were indicted by a federal grand jury under a set of U.S. conspiracy laws called “Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization” (RICO) laws. These conspiracy laws were ostensibly developed to aid the government in its prosecution of organized crime figures; however, they have been used with varying degrees of success against revolutionary organizations. Dr. Shakur was charged with conspiracy and participation in a clandestine paramilitary unit that carried out actual and attempted expropriations from several banks. Eight incidents were alleged to have occurred between December 1976 to October 1981. In addition he was charged with participation in the 1979 prison escape of Assata Shakur, who is now in exile in Cuba (the question of Dr. Shakur being charged with participation when in fact they alleged he masterminded her escape creates the true fact of COINTELPRO). After five years underground, Dr. Shakur was arrested on February 12, 1986.  He was supposed to be released in February 2016 but is being held likely for political reasons that violate his rights.  His legal team has pending litigation to address the refusal to release him.Life in Prison:Dr. Shakur is the father of six children.

"Norman Lowry","","Feb 04, 1953","","","Norm was arrested at a protest at a military recruitment office on August 1, 2011.  Lancaster County Judge Louis Farina told Norman Edgar Lowry, Jr. that unless he would forswear his nonviolent protest, the court would be obliged to impose the maximum sentence (7 years) for Lowry’s third consecutive arrest at an Armed Forces Recruiting Station in Lancaster.If only he would make such a promise, the judge implied, his sentence would be much lighter. Did he understand?, the court asked. Yes, Lowry answered. Will you make the pledge? No.Asked if he had anything more to say before being sentenced, Lowry presented a written statement and was invited to read it.  Lowry told the court that he utterly rejected the “obvious tyranny of unconstitutional wars, fought on the public credit card,” and explained that to cease his “seemingly small ‘no’ to our society’s love of extreme violence, racism, bigotry and poverty-production … would be to dishonor our creator and all of mankind. I have not and will not change my mind!”He went on to talk about the eight and one-half months he’d spent in the Lancaster County Prison since his arrest last August.“Often, including by the court,” he explained, “I have been told that I could achieve so much more on the outside of prison.  Yet I have nothing to prove!  ‘To say no to evil is perfect revolution.’ (Gandhi) Investing my life in prison, with those who are enslaved there (among the many more we enslave worldwide), makes more sense to me than investing my life with the slave-making/owning society outside of prison.”Norm, a grandfather who has worked as a chaplain in urban ministry to the homeless and destitute, was first arrested at the station one day in February, 2009, when he began calmly breaking windows on the recruiters’ vehicles. He refused bail and served seven months in jail, then returned to the office in January, 2010 to try and talk the soldiers out of their jobs collecting human fodder. When he refused to leave, he was arrested. Lowry again refused to post bail, was convicted of trespass and violating probation, and served nearly 18 months in jail. Last August 1, he visited the recruiter’s office again, blocked the door, and was arrested there for the third time.Farina imposed a one-to-seven year sentence, with the condition of parole being Lowry’s promise not to block the entrance of any armed forces recruiting station.  Norm has been unwilling to agree to this condition so will likely serve the full 7 years.","Yes","Pennsylvania","SCI Dallas","United States","","Norman","Lowry #KN-9758","Dallas","18612","","","","1000 Follies Road","War/Sanction Resistance","https://www.paypal.com/donate/?token=8llWIBmici5eFQOCcAtXL0TApmczmP2x6bKuzXWYdtx3IjTICaFfhekHoEqY_fHCOpb5nW","","Friday, August 31, 2018","Imprisoned","nukeresister@igc.org","https://www.facebook.com/The-Nuclear-Resister-135445896495485/","","Wednesday, April 12, 2017 - 12:33"

"Oscar Lopez Rivera","","Jan 06, 1943","","","Oscar Lopez Rivera is a Puerto Rican Independista and political prisoner serving 70 years for seditious conspiracy.  He is the only remaining Independista remaining behind bars, the other eleven were granted clemency by President Clinton.  Just before leaving office in January of 2017, President Obama commuted Oscar's sentence.Personal BackgroundOscar López Rivera was born in San Sebastián, Puerto Rico on January 6, 1943. His family moved to the U.S. when he was nine years old. At the age of 14, he moved to Chicago to live with a sister. At age 18, he was drafted into the army and served in Vietnam and awarded the Bronze Star. When he returned to Illinois from the war in 1967, he found that drugs, unemployment, housing, health care and education in the Puerto Rican community had reached dire levels and set to work in community organizations to improve the quality of life for his people.He was a well-respected community activist and an independence leader for many years prior to his arrest. Oscar worked in the creation of both the Puerto Rican High School and the Puerto Rican Cultural Center. He was also involved in the struggle for bilingual education in public schools and to force universities to actively recruit Latino students, staff, and faculty. He worked on ending discrimination in public utilities like Illinois Bell, People’s Gas, and Commonwealth Edison.Oscar was one of the founders of the Rafael Cancel Miranda High School, now known as the Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos High School and the Juan Antonio Corretjer Puerto Rican Cultural Center. He was a community organizer for the Northwest Community Organization (NCO), ASSPA, ASPIRA and the 1st Congregational Church of Chicago. He helped to found FREE, a half-way house for convicted drug addicts, and ALAS, an educational program for Latino prisoners at Stateville Prison in Illinois.Legal CaseIn 1975, Oscar was forced underground, along with other comrades.  The FBI claimed that he was one of the leaders of the Fuerzas Armadas de Liberación Nacional (FALN), a Puerto Rican nationalist clandestine group that fought for the independence of Puerto Rico.  Oscar has neither confirmed nor denied his involvement in FALN and out of principle has refused to denounce armed struggle as a legitimate means to gaining independence.On May 29, 1981 Oscar was captured in Chicago after five years underground.  Oscar was found guilty on five counts involving seditious conspiracy, armed robbery, weapons violations and interstate transporation of stolen propert.  He was sentenced to 55 years in prison.Political Prisoner StatusAt the time of their arrest, Lopez Rivera and the others declared themselves to be combatants in an anti-colonial war against the United States to liberate Puerto Rico from U.S. domination and invoked prisoner of war status. They argued that the U.S. courts did not have jurisdiction to try them as criminals and petitioned for their cases to be handed over to an international court that would determine their status. The U.S. Government, however, did not recognize their request.The sentences received by Lopez Rivera and the other Nationalists were judged to be “out of proportion to the nationalists’ offenses.” Statistics showed their sentences were almost 20 times greater than sentences for similar offenses by the American population at large.For many years, numerous national and international organizations criticized Lopez Rivera’ incarceration categorizing it as political imprisonment. His disproporionate sentence, the targeting of him and others by the FBI beforehand, the nebulous charges of conspiracy, the political nature of the charges made against Oscar, and the intentional isolation and long-term confinement he has endured all make it clear that Oscar Lopez Rivera is not simply a prisoner, but a political prisoner.Life in PrisonFrom the moment Oscar was sentenced, he has spent his time in long-term solitary confinement in high security prisons far away from his family and support network. Amnesty International and the House of Representatives’ Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Administration of Justice both criticized the conditions. The conditions were found to be in violation of the U.N. Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners. A federal judge also addressed his concerns in the case of Baraldine vs. Meese.Attempted Prison EscapeIn 1988, he was convicted of conspiracy to escape along with Jaime Delgado (a veteran independence leader), Dora Garcia (a prominent community activist), and Kojo Bomani Sababu (a New Afrikan Prisoner of War).  He was given another 15 years for the attempted escape.From 1986 to 1999 Oscar was held in the most maximum security prisons in the federal prison system, first in Marion and then the Administrative Maximum Unit at Florence, CO.In Marion he refused to work for the federal prison industry, UNICOR, because the work involved producing coaxial cables for the military.  He also helped launch a successful phone campaign from supporters to get guards at Florence to stop nightly rounds that were intentionally waking prisoners  every 30 minutes, preventing them from sleeping through the night.President Clinton Offers Clemency In 1999, President Clinton offered clemency to eleven Puerto Rican political prisoners and a reduced sentence to Oscar.  He refused the offer because in part of the agreement Rivera would have had to renounce armed struggle as a legitimate form of gaining independence for Puerto Rico.Oscar’s Upcoming Parole HearingOscar remains the last of the Puerto Rican nationalists in this case to remain in prison.  Now 67, and just having lost his sister, the efforts for Oscar to be released on parole at his next hearing have been stepped up.  The National Boricua Human Rights Network is gathering as many petition signatures and letters of support as possible in the lead up to the hearing.  You can download the letter and help free Oscar now.SupportNational Boricua Human Rights NetworkLetter in Support of Oscar’s ReleaseMediaFALN POW Flier","Yes","Indiana","Terre Haute FCI","United States","","Oscar","López Rivera #87651-024","Terre Haute","47808","","","","P.O.

"Osman Evcan","","","","","Osman, born in 1959 in Samsun, is an anarchist prisoner who spent the last 23 years in prison. İn 1992, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison with the charges of being a member of a leftist terrorist group and robbery. He was also imprisoned for 9 years between 1980-1989. Since Osman adopted anarchist ideas in 2003, he also became vegan and supports animal liberation struggles.Osman Evcan was imprisoned in many different prisons all over the country during his conviction. He built his life fighting against authoritarian violence and especially the violence and oppression which is a systemic part of the prison’s hierarchical structure, and he still continues his fight against prison’s oppressive mentality, without giving an inch, aspiring to the right standards for anarchist, vegan, libertarian individuals.Osman’s first barnburner act was his hunger strike in 2011 for vegan food to be available in prison which lasted 42 days. During his hunger strike the anarchists, animal liberationists from all over the World and in Turkey supported Osman’s fight to access vegan food in prison. After 42 days of hunger strike the government gave in and made regulations for the vegan and vegetarian prisoners: “Vegan or vegetarian prisoners demands will be accepted as long as its limited by subsistence allowance.” After this victory of all anarchists, animal liberationists and political prisoners, Osman continued to be in the anarchist struggle during his time in prison. He has supported the LGBT, Animal Liberation, women's rights, anti-imperialist struggles outside prison and he made hunger strikes to protest the animal massacre during each ‘feast of sacrifice’ every year for 3 days. He wrote articles to support nature, ethnic and different identities against the government’s and comprador bourgeoisie’s raids and he still continues his political fight as much as he can from prison.He self-criticized himself by saying that both capitalist and socialist system forms for being are statist and colonist formations. To quote his own words: “Veganism is not only a capitalism contrast it also includes socialism contrast. Veganism is civilization contrast. Veganism has an all out attitude against technological destruction, violence, human species alienation to nature and to itself, ecological pillage, pollution, colonialism, global warming. Act of civilization has a common history with statist forms of organizations. The idea of a state grown up process starting from primitive-simple history ongoing modernization continuum for thousands of years and transforming to nation state is a result of civilization. We cant separate this ongoing, mutually reinforcing facts that produce each other, from each other. Veganism is a radical attitude against all…”In Kocaeli no 1 high security prison, the pressure against him continued to increase. After his hunger strike for 33 days on June 2015 he took vegan food supplies one step further and he gained the right to get vegan food from outside the prisons. The prison administration usurped this gain due to arbitrarily reasons. Osman Evcan continued his hunger strike since 10 November 2015 and won the fight in late December 2015.","Yes","Kocaeli","Kocaeli 1 Nolu F Tipi Cezaevi","Turkey","","Osman","Evcan","Kandıra","","","","","A-7-21","Anarchist","","","","Imprisoned","abcinstanbul@riseup.net","","","Wednesday, March 16, 2016 - 22:35"

The government monitored all his communication, whether it was by mail, email, fax or telephone. They bugged his home, office and hotel rooms.The government’s surveillance even extended to the home of his office manager of 10 years, Kelly Tubbs, who was never involved with the Help the Needy charity.The trial lasted 17 weeks. The government called over 50 witnesses and the defense only called one witness for 15 minutes.Terrorism was alluded to throughout the trial. This happened in spite of the fact that Dr. Dhafir was never charged with terrorism and the prosecution had filed a successful motion to prevent the defense from raising the issue of terrorism during the trial. For example, the prosecution would bring up the fact that Dr. Dhafir was a Salafi and so was Osama bin Laden.During sentencing, the government alleged that Dr. Dhafir was a “national security risk” and requested an increased sentence. An allegation that Dr. Dhafir was never given an opportunity to defend against since it was not brought up during trial.

"Robert Seth Hayes","http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/34DDFN74AVQN5","Oct 15, 1948","","","Seth Hayes is a member of the Black Panther Party and the Black Liberation Army, he was framed and convicted of murdering a NYC police officer in 1973. He was charged with seven counts of attempted murder and one count of murder in the first degree.  He has repeatedly been denied parole, not based on his record in prison but because of his political beliefs and work with the Black Panther Party. Personal BackgroundRobert Seth Hayes was born in Harlem, New York in October 1947.  His father, John Franklin Hayes, was the child of sharecroppers and came to New York City from South Carolina; his mother, Francine Washington Hayes, moved to New York from Pittsburgh.  Both of Mr. Hayes’ parents worked for the U.S. Postal Service, trying to provide a better life for Seth and his four brothers and sisters.  They also instilled in their children the desire to work for the betterment of their community.  Seth writes, “My mother  taught me to visualize family universally, not individually.”  Seth’s father was a World War II veteran and a member of the United Negro Improvement Association, the Black Nationalist organization founded by Marcus Garvey.Growing up in New York City, first in Harlem, later in the Bronx and Queens, Seth saw one Black neighborhood after another suffering from neglect, despair, anger and defeat.  At the same time, he recalls witnessing over the years a birth of hope and determination to overcome these conditions.After his schooling in New York City, Seth worked as a psychiatric aide at Creedmoor Hospital.Seth Drafted into the Vietnam WarSeth was born in the Bronx in 1968.  As a young man he was drafted into the Vietnam War.  Seth was wounded and awarded a variety of military awards including the Purple Heart, the National Defense Service Medal, the Vietnam Service Medal, and the Vietnam Campaign Medal. Back in the U.S., when riots exploded across the nation in response to the April 4th, 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King, Seth’s troop was ordered to assist in putting down the massive rebellions which took place and spread across the United States. According to Seth, “it was the saddest day of my life, and I could never identify again with the aims of the armed forces or the government.”After the assassination of Martin Luther King and the social upheaval which followed it, Robert Seth Hayes joined the Black Panther Party, working in the Party’s free medical clinics and free breakfast programs.  At the time, seven New York City police officers were breaking into his home, Robert had no police record prior to these charges.  He, along with many others in the BPP were forced underground from the constant FBI and police attacks and repression.Legal CaseOn June 5, 1973, a transit officer, Sidney Thompson, was shot and killed while trying to detain two individuals at transit station in the Bronx.  Seth and another person were arrested for the death of the transit officer.  Seth was convicted of the crime, in addition to eight counts of attempted murder of a NYC police officer, weapons possession, grand theft, and collective association.  He was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison. Seth has always maintained his innocence.Life in PrisonJailed for over 30 years, Seth has long since served the time he was sentenced to and while in prison he has worked as a librarian, pre release advisor, and AIDS councilor. He has remained drug and alcohol free throughout his entire period of incarceration and has maintained a charge free record in prison. Seth first came up for parole in 1998, but prison officials refused to release him and gave him another two years, after which he was again denied parole.  Prison officials are effectively punishing him for having been a member of the Black Panther Party, and of having remained true to his ideals after 30 years behind bars.Seth has been diagnosed with Hepatitis C and adult onset Diabetes since the year 2000. Unfortunately, despite his repeated requests Seth has not been receiving adequate health care from Clinton Correction Facility, (the prison where he is currently being held) and his condition has steadily deteriorated.MediaRobert Seth Hayes Audio Statement to the Upping the Ante Book LaunchSeth Hayes InterviewSeth Hayes Audio Interview (August 17 2002)","No","New York","Sullivan Correctional Facility","United States","","Robert","Seth Hayes #74-A-2280","Fallsberg","12733-0116","","","","P.O.

"Romaine “Chip” Fitzgerald","","Apr 11, 1949","","","Romaine “Chip” Fitzgerald, born and raised in Compton, California, joined the Southern California Chapter of the Black Panther Party in early 1969 as a teenager who had just been released from the California Youth Authority.  He is currently serving 2 life sentences for the frame up of the murder of a security guard and attempted murder of a CHP officer. Legal CaseShoot-OutOn September 7th, 1969, California Highway Patrol pulled over a Volkswagen with Romaine ‘Chip’ Fitzgerald and two other members of the Black Panther Party (Robert Williams and Luxey Irvin). According to the Los Angeles Times, the men were stopped on the corner of Compton Blvd and Van Ness Ave in Gardena, CA for a faulty taillight.During the traffic stop a shooting broke out, leaving one officer and Chip Fitzgerald injured. The three Black Panthers managed to escape from the scene, leaving the injured officer in possession of Fitzgerald’s driver’s license.The next day, Chip escaped another shootout with police as he and the others attempted to flee from the house they were held up at. The other two men were arrested during the altercation with one of the men shot in the leg. Fitzgerald, still suffering from a gunshot wound to the head, managed to escape to the Panther headquarters in South-Central Los Angeles. There, Fitzgerald was able to receive treatment, but was informed on by a police informant. Police raided the headquarters only to find a blood-soaked jacket. Chip managed to escape arrest for a third time.Chip avoided being arrested until October 9th, when he was detained without incident. After being taken custody, he was informed that he was not only charged with the attempted murder of the CHP officer, but was also being charged with the murder of a private security guard, Barge Miller.Barge MillerOn September 29, 1969 at 1:42 am, Barge Miller a security guard at Vons Shopping Center located at El Segundo and Avalon Boulevards in Los Angeles was shot and robbed while sitting in his car. Two men were seen fleeing from the scene by a witness, James Coleman.Coleman later identified Romaine Fitzgerald as one of the men fleeing from the scene. While Coleman claims he did not get a good look at the shooter due to the fluorescent lighting of the parking lot, he was sure it was Chip. Despite his confidence, he admitted Chip looked different in court than when he had seen him during the early morning hours of September 29, 1969. He claimed Fitzgerald’s hair was now shorter.During the investigation, Coleman was shown several photographs of suspects, including one of Romaine Fitzgerald, but he could not identify Chip as the one who committed the crime. Later, he denied ever stating that he couldn’t identify Fitzgerald. However, the only time he was able to identify Chip was in court, sitting at the defendant’s table. During cross-examination, the witness was not even able to describe the judge in the case, when asked to describe him without looking.According to Chip, because of the gunshot wound to his head, he kept a two-inch wide gauze bandage on the wound for about three or four weeks. He had removed the bandage about three to five days prior to his arrest on October 9, 1969. Coleman stated nothing about a gauze bandage, something that is hard to miss. Chip denied being in the vicinity of the Vons parking lot during the early morning hours of September 29, 1969, and denied participating in any way in the shooting or robbing of Barge Miller. He testified that he never went outside at night before October 9, 1969, because he did not want to infect his head injury.Chip had witnesses that he was not at the Vons Shopping center during the murder. Doris Haughton and her sister, Janice Sadler shared an apartment with Romaine Fitzgerald and stated that he had not left the apartment on the evening of September 28, 1969.Despite his witnesses, he was convicted of first-degree murder and was sentenced to death in 1970. Later, the death sentence was commuted to life. Chip was also tried for the attempted murder of the CHP officer. During the trial, the officer admitted that he had orders to shoot members of the Black Panther Party. Despite this admission, the judge in the case ordered the jury to ignore the statement. Chip was subsequently found guilty and was sentenced to life for his involvement in the shootout.Chip and his supporters, believe the murder of Barge Miller was pinned on him because of his membership in the Black Panther Party and because of his previous altercations with the police. Despite the conviction, he has maintained his innocence in the death of Barge Miller.ParoleChip has a good chance of release because of changes in California parole law. Currently, people over the age of 65 who have served 25 years or more are prioritized for release. The seriousness of the original offense is no longer enough to deny parole – “some evidence” of current dangerousness is required. And Chip’s age at the time of his arrest – just 19 – is a factor to be considered at his hearing. Chip has also suffered from a stroke, and has had no incident reports since 2008 (when he was attacked by 2 young men and responded in self-defense).  Chip's next parole hearing is in 2016.","Yes","California","Kern Valley State Prison","United States","","Romaine","Fitzgerald B-27527","Delano","93216","A-1-105","","","P.O.

"Ronald Reed","","Aug 31, 1950","","","Ronald Reed is a former 60s civil rights activist. In 1969, Reed was also among the students at St. Paul Central High School who demanded black history courses and organized actions against racist teachers. He was also instrumental in helping to integrate college campuses in Minnesota. During this period, Reed began to look toward revolutionary theory and began to engage in political street theater with other young black revolutionaries in the city of St. Paul.Reed went on to join the Black United Front.  In 1970 he was convicted of shooting a St. Paul police officer. Twenty-five years after the killing, Reed was arrested and convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit first degree-murder. He is serving life in prison.Legal Case:Shooting on Hague Avenue On May 22, 1970, St. Paul officer James Sackett was responding to a bogus emergency call at a home in the 800 block of Hague Avenue. While responding to the call, Sackett was ambushed by a sniper and killed. Police immediately looked at Black radicals as those responsible for the incident, arresting several men they claimed were members of the Black Panther Party. The men were released for lack of evidence.A young woman by the name of Connie Trimble was also arrested and charged with making the call that led to the ambush of the cop. Though it came out in the trial that she connected to the incident, Trimble refused to reveal the names of the others involved. She was acquitted of the charges against her but served time in jail for contempt of court.During the trial of Trimble, confidential ""informants"" accused Trimble of being a Black Panther, alleging that she and other Black Panther commandos were acting under the orders of Panther leader Ronald Reed.The Robbery At 8 pm, on October 20, 1970, three armed men entered the Ames Plaza Bank with the intent of expropriating funds. A shootout took place between a security guard and the men involved in the bank expropriation. The guard, who was also an off duty cop, was shot in the chest. Reed was arrested in St. Paul 10 days after the Omaha incident and Reed was arrested on November 13th in southeast Minneapolis.Police claimed to have found in Reed possession detailed notes laying out a plot to kidnap Minnesota's governor, Harold LeVander and St. Paul City Council Member Rosalie Butler. They also claimed they discovered a statement indicating plans to hijack a United Airlines jet out of Minneapolis. The plot was designed to win the release of Connie Trimble and Larry Clark. According to newspapers, Reed also intended to demand to release of Angela Davis and a young activist named Gary Hogan. Despite police claims, the charges of conspiring to commit air piracy were dismissed because there was no evidence of the conspiracy other than the notes. In recent articles, Reed's brother has stated these charges were fabricated against his brother. Reed and Clark were still charged with the robbery and were extradited to Nebraska. They were each sentenced to 10 to 25 years in prison.On October 26, 1976, Reed escaped, but was arrested in Los Angeles on February 3, 1977. Reed served 13 years and Larry served less than 8 years.The Arrests The case regarding the death of the officer Sackett remained cold for nearly twenty-five years. But in 1994, during an interview with 5 Eyewitness News, Connie Trimble claimed that Ronald Reed was with her when she made the call. This statement re-opened the investigation.In January 2005, during a grand jury hearing over the killing of Officer Sackett, Connie Trimble-Smith, repeated her claims that Reed was the one that encouraged her to make the call. The grand jury indicted Ronald Reed and Larry Clark and the two were arrested. Reed was living in Chicago, working as a pipe fitter. Clark was homeless living in Minneapolis.Police stated the two men had been the prime suspects since the killing. Originally, they claimed Reed and Clark were Black Panthers bent on killing cops. According to the media and prosecutors, the Twin Cities Black Panthers were involved in drug dealing, bomb making and other acts of ""terror"" that led to the killing of Officer Sackett. The catch to this issue was that there was no Black Panther Party in the Twin Cities. No raids or arrests targeting Panthers as seen in many different cities in the country at the time ever took place in the Twin Cities.Prosecutors later altered their position claiming that Reed and his co-defendant were ""Black Militants"" not ""Black Panthers"" - a term so broad it could have one time included Jesse Jackson. Reed and others, they claim, engaged in the ambush in hopes of impressing the Black Panther leadership and starting a chapter in St. Paul.The Testimonies The case rested on the testimony of several prosecution witnesses. Connie Trimble who earlier testified that Reed persuaded her to make the call that lured the cop into the ambush recanted some her earlier remarks. She claimed that Reed did not murder Sackett and, in fact, had been duped like her. She stated after the two made the call to the police, they went to Larry Clark's home and stayed together the rest of the night.Trimble also testified that she made the call but that they were calling the cops on a neighbor who had been having a party. Neither She nor Reed were aware of any plot to kill the officer.Another witness, Joseph Garret who claimed to be a Panther with Reed, stated that Reed had asked him if he was interested in helping him ""bring down the first pig."" Garrett claimed he that he declined. Several days before the shooting, Garret was stopped by a traffic cop and was found in possession of a gun. After a discussion, Garrett told the officer to ""watch the rooftops."" He was arrested shortly after the shooting of Sackett, but was released.John Griffin, presently serving a 30-year drug sentence, testified that Reed informed him what it was like to kill a cop and also order a bombing campaign that Griffin backed out of. The problem with this testimony is that Reed was in prison serving the 13 years in Nebraska during the time Griffin claimed these things took place.The fact remains the police were not able to produce the murder weapon, an eyewitness to the shooting, or any physical evidence tying Reed to the killing. Despite this, Reed and Clark were both found guilty and sentence to Life in prison.In April 2006, Larry Clark began his trial. Clark was tried separately from Reed, but was still found guilty one month later. The ABCF has been contacted by Larry Clark's attorney demanding that he not be placed on any lists.Helping RonRon is seeking help with his appeals. He welcomes help from any outside organizations or individuals. Here are links to two appeals.

"Ruchell ""Cinque"" Magee","","Mar 17, 1939","","","Personal BackgroundRuchell is the longest held political prisoner in the U.S., having been locked up since 1963. Politicized in prison, he later participated in the Marin County Courthouse Rebellion, the attempted liberation of political prisoner George Jackson.  Ruchell Magee pled guilty to the charge of aggravated kidnapping for his part in the assault. In return for his plea, the Attorney General asked the Court to dismiss the charge of murder (Magee being the shooter of Judge Haley). Magee later attempted unsuccessfully to withdraw his plea, and was sentenced in 1975 to life in prison. He has lost numerous bids for parole. He has also worked tirelessly as a jailhouse lawyer, working on his own case and helping many other prisoners win their freedom.He had been in L.A. for 6 months when he and his cousin Leroy got in a fight over a $10 bag of marijuana.  In court, the two ended up with trumped up charges of kidnapping and robbery and he was given life in prison.While in prison Ruchell began learning the long and rich history of Black liberation history. He adopted the middle name of Cinque, after the enslaved African who led the takeover of the slave ship Amistad, which eventually lead to the freedom of all the slaves on board. He began petitioning his unjust sentence to no avail. Although critically wounded on August 7, 1970, Magee was the sole survivor among the four brave Black men who conducted the courthouse slave rebellion, leaving him to be charged with everything they could throw at him.The Marin Courthouse Incident - “All right gentlemen, hold it right there. We’re taking over!”Armed to the teeth, Jonathan Jackson, 17, George’s, younger brother, had raided the Marin Courtroom and tossed guns to prisoners William Christmas and James McClain, who in turn invited Ruchell to join them. Ru seized the hour spontaneously as they attempted to escape by taking a judge, assistant district attorney and three jurors as hostages in that audacious move to expose to the public the brutally racist prison conditions and free the Soledad Brothers (John Clutchette, Fleeta Drumgo, and George Jackson).McClain was on trial for assaulting a guard in the wake of Black prisoner Fred Billingsley’s murder by prison officials in San Quentin in February, 1970. With only four months before a parole hearing, Magee had appeared in the courtroom to testify for McClain.The four revolutionaries successfully commandeered the group to the waiting van and were about to pull out of the parking lot when Marin County Police and San Quentin guards opened fire. When the shooting stopped, Judge Harold Haley, Jackson, Christmas, and McClain lay dead; Magee was unconscious (See photo)and seriously wounded as was the prosecutor. A juror suffered a minor injury. In a chain of events leading to August 7, on January 13, 1970, a month before the Billingsley slaughter, a tower guard at Soledad State Prison had shot and killed three Black captives on the yard, leaving them unattended to bleed to death — Cleveland Edwards, “Sweet Jugs” Miller, and the venerable revolutionary leader, W. L. Nolen, all active resisters in the Black Liberation Movement (BLM) behind the walls. (Others included George Jackson, Jeffrey Gauldin (Khatari), Hugo L.A. Pinell (Yogi Bear), Steve Simmons (Kumasi), Howard Tole, and the late Warren Wells.).After the common verdict of “justifiable homicide” was returned and the killer guard exonerated at Soledad, another white-racist guard was beaten and thrown from a tier to his death. Three prisoners, leeta Drumgo, John Clutchette, and Jackson were charged with his murder precipitating the case of The Soledad Brothers and a campaign to free them led by college professor and avowed Communist, Angela Davis, and Jonathan Jackson.Magee had already spent at least seven years studying law and deluging the courts with petitions and lawsuits to contest his own illegal conviction in two fraudulent trials. As he put it, the judicial system “used fraud to hide fraud” in his second case after the first conviction was overturned on an appeal based on a falsified transcript. His strategy, therefore, centered on proving that he was a slave, denied his constitutional rights and held involuntarily.Therefore, he had the legal right to escape slavery as established in the case of the African slave, Cinque, who had escaped the slave ship, Armistad, and won freedom in a Connecticut trial. Thus, Magee had to first prove he’d been illegally and unjustly incarcerated for over seven years. He also wanted the case moved to the Federal Courts and the right to represent himself.Moreover, Magee wanted to conduct a trial that would bring to light the racist and brutal oppression of Black prisoners throughout the state. “My fight is to expose the entire system, judicial and prison system, a system of slavery.. This will cause benefit not just to myself but to all those who at this time are being criminally oppressed or enslaved by this system.”On the other hand, Angela Davis, his co-defendant, charged with buying the guns used in the raid, conspiracy, etc., was innocent of any wrongdoing because the gun purchases were perfectly legal and she was not part of the original plan. Davis’ lawyers wanted an expedient trial to prove her innocence on trumped up charges. This conflict in strategy resulted in the trials being separated. Davis was acquitted of all charges and released in June of 1972.Ruchell fought on alone, losing much of the support attending the Davis trial. After dismissing five attorneys and five judges, he won the right to defend himself. The murder charges had been dropped, and Magee faced two kidnap charges. He was ultimately convicted of PC 207, simple kidnap, but the more serious charge of PC 209, kidnap for purposes of extortion, resulted in a disputed verdict. According to one of the juror’s sworn affidavit, the jury voted for acquittal on the PC 209 and Magee continues to this day to challenge the denial and cover-up of that acquittal. ","No","California","CSP - Los Angeles County","United States","","Ruchell","Magee #A92051","Lancaster","93539-8457","","","","P.O.

After the raid police officials allowed news photographers to take humiliating photos of the Black Panthers being strip searched on the street.Russell and four others (who became known as the “Philly Five”) were immediately charged with the attack.  They went underground and continued to struggle for New Afrikan self-determination as part of the Black Liberation Army.Legal CaseIn January of 1972 Russell was captured.  He was convicted of the attack on the police station and sentenced to life.Life in Prison1977 Prison EscapeRussell escaped with three others from Huntingdon State Prison in 1977.  Two were recaptured and the third was killed during the escape.  Russell remained at large for 27 days, leading to a massive manhunt by local, state and federal forces, as well as citizen recruits from nearby white, rural areas.From his capture in 1977 until 1989 Russell was shipped from state, county and federal prisons, kept in long term solitary confinement the entire time.  In 1979 he was forcibly transferred to the Fairview State Hospital for the Criminally Insane. While at Fairview he was forcibly drugged, which in one case lead to him being hospitalized when he was overdosed.1980 Prison EscapeIn March of 1980 he escaped prison with a fellow revolutionary after a New Afrikan activist smuggled a revolver and sub-machine gun into the institution.  Three days later all three were captured after a gun battle with local, state and county police, and FBI agents.Camp Hill Prison RiotIn 1989, Pennsylvania prison Camp Hill erupted in a riot because of overcrowding and inhumane conditions. Despite being held in a Dallas prison and having nothing to do with the incident, Russell was implicated in it and as a result was transferred to the notorious Marion Supermax prison over 1,000 miles from friends, family and supporters.Supporters fought to have Russell removed from solitary confinement in Marion and released into general population.  They were finally successful in December of 1989.Russell Returns to Solitary ConfinementUnfortunately Russell was placed back into long term solitary confinement in 1991 at SCI Greene in Waynesburg, PA. It was only after a lawsuit was filed in May 2013 that in February of 2014, Russell was released from solitary confinement after roughly 22 consecutive years.MediaABCF Pamphlet on MaroonUS court upholds nine year solitary confinement of Philadelphia man June 3 2000.  Russell Maroon Shoatz released from Solitary Confinement February 20, 2014.Maroon the Implaccable (collection of writings published by PM Press) ","Yes","Pennsylvania","SCI Graterford","United States","","Russell","Maroon Shoatz #AF-3855","Graterford","19426 – 0246","","","","P.O.

"Sundiata Acoli (Clark Squire)","","Jan 14, 1937","","","Sundiata Acoli is a New Afrikan political prisoner of war.  A tireless worker for black liberation, Sundiata was a prominent member of the Harlem chapter of the Black Panther Party.  Continally targeted by the FBI’s illegal COINTELPRO operation, Sundiata continued the struggle underground with the Black Liberation Army.  In 1973 he, Zayd and Assata Shakur were ambushed by New Jersey state troopers.  Zayd Shakur was killed, while Assata was wounded and taken into custody.  One state trooper was killed in the attack and another injured.  In a political charged and biased trial Sundiata was sentenced to life plus 30 years.Personal BackgroundSundiata Acoli (born in 1939, as Clark Edward Squire), a New Afrikan political prisoner of war, mathematician, and computer analyst, was born January 14, 1937, in Decatur, Texas, and raised in Vernon, Texas. He graduated from Prairie View A & M College of Texas in 1956 with a B.S. in mathematics and for the next 13 years worked for various computer-oriented firms, mostly in the New York area.During the summer of 1964 he did voter registration work in Mississippi. In 1968 he joined the Harlem Black Panther Party and did community work around issues of schools, housing, jobs, child care, drugs, and police brutality.In 1969 he and 13 others were arrested in the Panther 21 conspiracy case. He was held in jail without bail and on trial for two years before being acquitted, along with all other defendants, by a jury deliberating less than two hours.Upon release, FBI intimidation of potential employers shut off all employment possibilities in the computer profession and stepped-up COINTELPRO harassment, surveillance, and provocations soon drove him underground.Legal CaseIn May 1973, while driving the New Jersey Turnpike, he and his comrades were ambushed by N.J. state troopers. One companion, Zayd Shakur, was killed, another companion, Assata Shakur, was wounded and captured. One state trooper was killed and another wounded, and Sundiata was captured days later.After a highly sensationalized and prejudicial trial he was convicted of the death of the state trooper and was sentenced to Trenton State Prison (TSP) for life plus 30 years consecutive.Upon entering TSP he was subsequently confined to a new and specially created Management Control Unit (MCU) solely because of his political background. He remained in MCU almost five years, … let out of the cell only ten minutes a day for showers and two hours twice a week for recreation.In September 1979, the International Jurist interviewed Sundiata and subsequently declared him a political prisoner. A few days later prison officials secretly transferred him during the middle of the night to the federal prison system and put him en route to the infamous federal concentration camp at Marion, Illinois, although he had no federal charges or sentences.Life in PrisonMarion is one of the highest security prisons in the U.S., also one of the harshest, and there Sundiata was locked down 23 hours a day …. In July 1987 he was transferred to the federal penitentiary at Leavenworth, Kansas.In the fall of 1992, Sundiata became eligible for parole. He was not permitted to attend his own parole hearing and was only allowed to participate via telephone from USP Leavenworth. Despite an excellent prison work, academic and disciplinary record, despite numerous job offers in the computer profession, and despite thousands of letters on his behalf, Sundiata was denied parole. Instead, at the conclusion of a 20 minute telephone hearing, he was given a 20-year hit, the longest hit in New Jersey history.The Parole Board’s stated reason for the 20-year hit was Sundiata’s membership in the Black Panther Party and the Black Liberation Army prior to his arrest, the receipt of hundreds of “Free Sundiata” form letters that characterized him as a New Afrikan Prisoner of War, and the feeling that the punitive aspects of his sentence had not been satisfied and that rehabilitation was not sufficiently achieved. The real reason for the 20-year hit is to attempt to force Sundiata to renounce his political beliefs and to proclaim to the world that he was wrong to struggle for the liberation of his people.In late 2014, a state appeals court ordered his release on parole but the attorney general appealed it and it will be heard by the NJ Supreme Court.","Yes","Maryland","FCI Cumberland","United States","","Sundiata","Acoli #39794-066 (Squire)","Cumberland","21501","","","","P.O.

"Tamara Sol Farias Vergara","","","","","Charged on January 21, 2014, with the shooting of a security guard BancoEstado in revenge for the death of the anarchist comrade Sebastian Overluij. She wass stopped when entering a nearbye station a with the loaded revolver. Sol is the niece of the Vergara brothers, killed by the dictatorship and granddaughter of Luisa and Manuel, who have held a memorial every March 29th, the day that their children were murdered.On February 4, 2015, the court in Santiago issued its judgment against Tamara Sol. The court acknowledged the mitigating factor of her previous irreproachable conduct, but denied that Tamara Sol substantially collaborated in clarifying the facts, considering that neither her statement given to the prosecution at the stage of the investigation with which she admitted to the facts, nor her consent to the realisation of several expert reports contributed anything, since the evidence was already available to the authorities from the moment of her arrest. In addition, the defense’s proposed mitigating circumstance of diminished capacity, based on expert testimonies by psychologists, was dismissed.In fact, the presiding judge adopted the prosecution’s argument that spoke of a premeditated action, alleging that this has been demonstrated by the cry ""revenge for Sebastián"" attributed to Tamara Sol at the time of opening fire on the guard, and emphasising the fact she chose not to make any declaration during the trial. Thus, while the defense sought recognition of two mitigating circumstances in order to request a sentence of 3 to 5 years and the application of the alternative sentence of release under intensive supervision instead of actual imprisonment, this objective was not reached.In particular, Tamara Sol Farías Vergara was convicted of aggravated attempted homicide and sentenced to 7 years in prison, perpetual absolute disqualification from holding any public duty and office and from practicing political rights, and absolute disqualification from maintaining or obtaining any professional license for the duration of the prison sentence. She was also convicted of theft regarding the gun of the security guard and sentenced to 61 days in prison and a fine of almost 215,000 Chilean pesos (300 euros) and ordered to pay the court costs.Address is correct as of: 01/02/15.","No","","Centro Detención Preventiva San Miguel","Chile","","Tamara","Sol Farias Vergara","Santiago","","","","","Torre 1","Anarchist","","","Thursday, January 21, 2021","Imprisoned","","","","Wednesday, March 16, 2016 - 22:35"

"Thomas Meyer-Falk","","","","","An update from Thomas on June 6, 2013:After being imprisoned for almost 17 years nonstop, from the 8th of July 2013 onward I will be held in Preventative Detention (Sicherungsverwahrung, a form of “security detention” in Germany for convicts who have served full terms, but are still considered to be a risk to “public safety” and therefore detained past the end of their sentence). So I want to use this final period of my prison sentence to write a balance sheet of sorts.[Preventive Detention is based on a Nazi-law from 1933 which allowes the state to keep someone behind the bars, after he/she has finished the sentence, maybe for the rest of her/his life. Thomas hopes to get released in summer 2023 at the latest.]Solitary confinement phaseThough it is still used today, particularly in the German justice system, the notion of continuous solitary confinement (incommunicado detention) was more common in the 70s and 80s. For example Günther Finneisen was in complete isolation in the prison JVA Celle for 15 years straight. Peter Wegener’s detention passed its 18th anniversary in May of 2013, all of which was spent in an isolation wing.My own imprisonment began with solitary confinement in Stuttgart-Stammheim, then in 1998 for a few months in Straubing (Bavaria). After I defended myself effectively in court against the shift to Straubing, I was held in the prison JVA Bruchsal (Baden-Württemberg) until May 2007. Since May 2007 I have remained in “normal detention” (Normalvollzug), which means that I can meet other prisoners in the yard and visit other prisoners in their cells, and they can visit me in mine.So what is this solitary confinement? Those held in isolation must spend time alone and cannot meet with other prisoners. Even the guards can only be seen when they bring you to the prison yard or to the shower cell, or hand you meals through the small hatch in the cell door. Depending on the local conditions, there is neither a radio nor a TV for either distraction or some sort of information. Visits from friends and relatives are severely restricted: you can see them behind bulletproof glass (just like in US movies), and guards are always present and listen to every word being said. Incoming and outgoing letters are read and sometimes copied by the prison administration, in order to be filed. The address of the recipient and sender are noted in lists.Before and after visits, prisoners get completely searched, including being stripped naked (even though the prisoner cannot have, and is not allowed, any physical contact with visitors). This also happens before and after being let out into the tiny yard which is topped with barbed wire.Those imprisoned in such isolation are no longer human beings, but potential sources of danger. More like a piece of meat that gets transported here and there under complete surveillance and control.The isolation cells are no luxury suites either: everything is sterile, screwed on tightly and mostly made out of metal. Having private clothing is forbidden, of course, and other personal belongings (like pens, paper, photographs) are reduced to an absolute minimum.This is how you live not only for days and weeks, but for years or whole decades. The aforementioned case of Günther F. was described as “scandalous” by a professor (Dr. Feest) in his commentary about the prison act.The so-called deprivation—the prohibition of any stimuli, and of course, preventing contact with other people—has unavoidable physical and psychological impairing effects.Some prisoners held in solitary confinement have had total psychological breakdowns, and there are suicide attempts, simply because they cannot stand the loneliness, the complete absence of anyone else. These people can only bare these conditions with psychotropic drugs. Others are more resilient, more resistant to the psychological burden, but do not remain unaffected by these harmful effects.Despite the fact that I have been in “normal detention” for six years now—which means that the cell is open for two and a half hours every weekday and five and half every weekend, so that I can meet other prisoners—I still prefer to limit my interactions to one or two prisoners at a time in specific circumstances, since situations with more people around me present too many stimuli for me to handle. Those who must live alone too much for so long, learn to accommodate themselves to such circumstances, in such a way that certain mechanisms also assume an independent reality.Thus, a reduced capacity to absorb what someone is saying, or the ability to concentrate on face-to-face conversations only, are part of those problems.As a rule, we can only read or hear about people who are held in solitary confinement when they are able to actively inform others about themselves (via letters, since there are no other possibilities). The sad thing is that there are so many people in isolation, who are unheard and unseen simply because they do not have the ability or the will to spread information about their own situation and draw attention to their lot.Abu Ghraib, the US Army’s torture facility (near Baghdad), which is largely forgotten today, became a public scandal because of photographs. In the age of the Internet, images are becoming more and more effective—and of places where no pictures exist, there is little to no reporting. This is the security that the justice authorities have, that their acts will not appear in the newspaper, will not ever go public.Execution of sentenceAt first glance, it might appear progressive if prisoners and people inSicherungsverwahrung are permitted to buy flat screens and the PlayStation 2. However, for both of these they had to struggle in the courts. Additionally it might not be helpful after their imprisonment to have reached the championship level in various PlayStation games, while at the same time never having seen a computer, nor being able to use one in a proficient way. Because computers (not to mention internet access) are forbidden inside prisons; it follows that after release none of the prisoners can use a computer in a proper way.Other than that there is little uplifting to report, apart from these technical innovations. In fact the security screw has been tightened more and more over the years. Year in and year out there are new restrictions: first all glass bottles are forbidden, then adhesive tape, wet glue, broomsticks, and so on. Also the ability to move within one prison building has considerably shrunk in many places.Whereas a few years ago inmates could visit one another in the entire prison building in Bruchsal, Mannheim and other facilities, today they are normally only permitted to stay in their own section, and will be savagely punished if they attempt to visit somebody in another prison wing.Wherever you look: cameras! So here is a similarity to living conditions in freedom: not a single step outside of the cell that wouldn’t be observed and controlled.Groups of “Russian-Germans”/repatriates from CIS states (former Soviet Republics) are under particular “control” inside the prisons. Even when it seems that there is little solidarity between and among the prisoners, those with relations to the former Soviet states show solidarity amongst themselves, partly separate themselves from others, do not co-operate with institutions, and give aid to each other (for example with tobacco and coffee). This course of action and the formation of a “subculture” create such a thorn in the side of judiciary, that it tries to break the solidarity of the groups through strict measures of security, surveillance and control. Even for those who do not join this “subculture” but are, according to their birth certificate, born in one of the former CIS states, security measures are imposed automatically and they are then called on to demonstrate, above all to the correctional establishment, that they have distanced themselves from those prisoners who associate themselves with it.Over the years quite a few told me that during their childhood in the Soviet Union they were described as “fucking Nazi Germans,” only to be called “fucking Russians” and treated as such in the prisons after their emigration to Germany.Within this balance sheet, one of the experiences that stand out as the most depressing is a death in prison. Now and again I have reported about the death of prisoners. In particular, Willi should be mentioned here. He was an HIV-positive fellow prisoner, whom the judiciary left to die in prison—despite all of his desperate attempts to spend his foreseeably short lifespan in freedom until his death.His death might have been symptomatic for the development of the (German) penal procedure: relentless hardness, to the end.ReviewersA balance would be incomplete without mentioning the role and power of the (psychiatric) reviewers.Generally speaking, whoever wants to be released “on probation” before finishing their sentence will be examined, often through psychologists of the institution, but in many cases also through external reviewers.For a court order in which release is decided, it is usually the reviewer which must state whether or not, “with regard to the convict, danger of his/her hazardousness, which became apparent through the committed crime, no longer persists” (see section 454 paragraph 2 of the penal procedure code).In practice then these experts are deciding about freedom or (continued) imprisonment, since if the reviewer’s opinion is positive, then concerned persons will be released and otherwise they will be kept under lock and key.In May 2013 the political magazine “Frontal 21” of the second channel of the state broadcaster ZDF reported about checkups in the care sector. The healthcare and nursing insurance providers order the MDK (medical service of the health insurance funds) to examine people who are in need of care in order to find out if a level of long-term care (1, 2 or 3) will be granted and, if yes, which one. In tens of thousands of cases the assessments are wrong (the ZDF documented the work of an independent advisor, and she alone debunked several thousands of assessments as false). People who are in visible need of care will be denied services, despite the fact that in the majority of cases the necessity of care is obvious.So (and this is the point of this little digression), if there is already such a high level of assessments which are simply wrong in a sector that is primarily there for making judgments concerning physical defects and limitations, why should it work better in the area of (forensic) psychiatry? In a sector where the criteria are even blurrier and even more dependent of the expert’s worldview!Particularly since the psychiatric reviewers make the final decision about release from prison, they don’t tend towards any overwhelming optimism in their assessments; no one wants to appear at the next day in Bild-Zeitung (most popular yellow Press in Germany) under the headline: “THIS reviewer set the LUNATIC free!” if the assessment should turn out wrong.Unlike the situation of care recipients there is neither a competent lobby nor independent authorities for the imprisoned that might reexamine the reports. In practice the courts take the reports of reviewers word for word, and issue their decisions without any further critical investigation (however, there are cases where the exact opposite occurs, such as a current one in the JVA Bruchsal, where a totally positive report for the inmate X. was rewritten by the judge in charge of the case until it was actually possible that this prisoner, convicted of a narcotic offense, be denied release from prison). So it is strung together from one bad report to the next, particularly for prisoners with long sentences.In my particular case, precisely due to the imminent Sicherungsverwahrung (and in all such cases), for me to be released from prison a reviewer would have to conclude that a possibility of reoffending is practically excluded; an assessment which—even for people who have never had problems with the penal law before—is hard to come to, since it tries to predict that I will not do something. Thus the courts expect the reviewers to make a prediction that will reach into the coming years.But how can a psychiatrist, genuinely and seriously, be able to predict what someone will be doing or not doing in a month, in a year, or in two years?This is one of the reasons I decided to not speak to psychologists or psychiatrists.Already in the 60s there were studies which gave proof of how the “dangerousness” of prisoners is grossly overrated—for whatever reasons each time. There is a dissertation by Dr. Michael Alex from 2010 (“Ex post facto preventative detention: a constitutional and criminal-political debacle”) in which he proved that, out of 77 ex-prisoners classified as extremely “dangerous” and linked to the highest probability of reoffending, 50 have never had troubles with the law again. Out of the 27 who committed offenses again, 10 have been sentenced to fines, and 5 have received suspended sentences. Only 12 of the ex-prisoners received non-suspended penalties, usually for theft, fraud or narcotic offenses. In three cases the measure of preventative detention was imposed. Consequently, in merely three out of 77 cases did the predicted “extreme danger” become real: less than 4% of the cases, despite the fact that all of the 77 ex-prisoners were previously classified as extremely dangerous by the courts and experts, and were supposed to receive Sicherungsverwahrung.Certainly this reviewer-problematic is not about to change anytime soon; thus the perspective from the captives’ point of view is more than pessimistic.Preventative detention (after completion of sentence)For me it was essentially relieving to know that I was sentenced toSicherungsverwahrung already. In this way the judiciary was not able to put pressure on me, at any point, by threatening to endorse the order for preventative detention, or to suddenly apply for it against me (which is legally still possible).Today it is mostly not known (anymore) that it was mainly representatives from communist and social democratic parties who, during the Weimar Republic, attempted to hinder the introduction of Sicherungsverwahrung. Already in 1928 none other than Kurt Tucholsky—whose sentence “Soldiers are murderers” became the battle cry for millions—positioned himself clearly against this type of preventative detention (“Down with the Sicherungsverwahrung” in: Die Weltbühne 1928, pp.838-840). It was the Nazis who introduced the preventative detention on November 24, 1933.During the period after 1949 it were representatives of the ruthless National Socialist justice, such as Eduard Dreher (who, being the head prosecutor of Innsbruck’s special court, enforced his share of death penalties in 1943), who were allowed to make a career in the West German justice system, and were significantly responsible for the commentary on, and thus also the implementation of, the Sicherungsverwahrung paragraphs.Already in 1952 the German Democratic Republic’s justice had decided that theSicherungsverwahrung is “fascist in its content”—by ruling of their highest court from 23 December 1952—and therefore was to be forbidden in East German territory.In our days, compared to the rest of penitentiary, the conditions of detention inSicherungsverwahrung are surely a little more pleasant and relaxed (though obviously nowhere near the conditions depicted in articles about Freiburg prison, namely by the bourgeois Press, which only licks the boots of ministers, politicians, and prison officials with headlines such as “Hotel behind bars”). However that may be, even a cage painted in gold always remains a cage!My own future prospectsThe prospects for my future might appear far from enjoyable, since I have to expect that I will be spending the next decade in preventative detention. However, I am in the extremely fortunate position to know people, friends and comrades, who are accompanying me, writing and visiting me, as well as actively supporting me.Additionally, there are groups that have been consistently showing solidarity, such as Anarchist Black Cross Berlin, Rote Hilfe e.V. (the German Red Aid), or Gefangenen Info (“Prisoner Info”).I would like to mention also the Berlin association Free Subscriptions for Prisoners, which arranges regular subscriptions to newspapers and magazines for hundreds of prisoners, including me.Thus I’m in good cheer that I will get through the forthcoming period relatively unscathed as someone “preventively detained” instead of as a “prison inmate.”At the very least, I will be better than those who haven’t got the luck to count on such wide support; those who remain locked up in their cells forgotten by the world, and live a life which has little to do with dignity and nothing with freedom.Updates can be found on these support-pages: i // iiRed anarchist skinhead Thomas Meyer-Falk still refuses to collaborate with any psychiatric reviewers.

He joined the US Military in 1963, and the following year was stationed at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba before being transferred off to spend the following year in the Vietnam War.Some time shortly after 1965, he was sentenced by a Massachusetts state court to five years in prison for armed robbery and assault, serving the last ten months in Massachusetts Correctional Institution – Cedar Junction. It was during these years that he became heavily politicized, through his interactions with other prisoners.Tom Joins the United Freedom FrontAfter his release in 1971, he married Carole and together they had three children, Jeremy, Tamara, and Jonathan.  The two of them became active in political organizing, particuarly with a Portland, Maine group known as SCAR. Much of this work centered around working with prisoners, ex-prisoners and their loved ones. This work rapidly expanded to many areas of social concern including employment and housing for people coming out of prison, housing, welfare, advocacy, transportation for visits of prisoners family, childcare, a bail fund and a bookstore. Through this work and the study required to do it effectively, class contradictions became very clear to Tom. Eventually these realities lead to become active in the armed clandestine movement. They eventually joined the United Freedom Front. Between 1975 and 1984 the UFF carried out at least 20 bombings and nine bank robberies in the northeastern United States, targeting corporate buildings, courthouses, and military facilities.Tom and Carole are ArrestedOn December 21, 1981 New Jersey police officer Philip Lamonaco was killed during a traffic stop.  The UFF were prime suspects in the incident, setting off the largest manhunt in NJ police history.After a decade of evading capture, all eight UFF members were arrested with Tom and Carole the last ones found in May of 1985 in Norfolk, VA.Legal CaseTom pled self-defense at his trial, while defense counsel showed that Lamonaco had emptied his .357 Magnum revolver at Manning and his associates.  He was sentenced on February 19, 1987 to 58 years in federal prison. He should be paroled from the federal system sometime around November 2015.Life in PrisonTom, like many political prisoners, has been designated a “high max” prisoner, which lead him to be on continual lockdown for the first 12 years in prison.  Tom has also been subject to physical abuse and denied medical attention while in prison.In 2006, his artwork was taken down from a show entitled “Can’t Jail the Spirit” at the University of Southern Maine from pressure by the Right.SupportSupport Site (currently down as of 3/27/17, but here is an archived version)NYC's Anarchist Black Cross's posts related to TomMediaShort AutobiographyWritingsArtVideo of Tom’s Banned Art ShowTom's book of paintings published by AK Press in 2014 For Love and Liberty","No","North Carolina","FCI Butner Medium II","United States","","Thomas","Manning #10373-016","Butner","27509","","","","P.O.

"Vadim Boyko","","Apr 18, 1996","1CcxWEswKjXZgXQCds5KcHfemzrAASVbuv","","Vadim Boyko is an antifascist supporter of FC Partyzan from Minsk. He was detained on March 22, 2016 together with other people on suspicion of participating in the attack on the right-wing hooligans that happened about two years ago. On March 10, 2017 sentenced to 4 years of jail. FC Partyzan (former MTZ-RIPO) is an antiracist football club that doesn’t exist any more, while there are still some active groups of hooligans involved in street fights. As reported, on June 29, 2014 a mob of Partyzan supporters attacked a trolley-bus carrying a gang of right-wing hooligans of FC Torpedo. The attackers blocked the vehicle and broke a few windows. In the following days the police detained ten Partyzan fans on suspicion of the attack, but they were eventually set free with no charges. The case was frozen.On March 22, 2016 cops carried out a series of searches in the flats of Partyzan supporters and detained a few people. As a result three of the detained – Ilya Volovik, Vadim Boyko and Dmitry Tsekhanovich – remained in custody with charges of aggravated hooliganism facing 10 years in jail. Later Dmitry was released with travel restrictions, the other two remain in custody.  At the moment there are 6 defendants to the case, including 2 former hooligans who were accused of selling drugs and allegedly testified against the others. Meanwhile, the cops initiated another case against Ilya Volovik – leadership in an unregistered organisation, claiming that he was the leader of a hooligan gang.It should be pointed out that antiracist football hooligans are not always close to anarchists in any ways. Part of them shares patriotic, homophobic, sexist tendencies, and we wouldn’t like to support such people. At the same time, we can’t close our eyes on the clearly political connotation of the case, since last year was rich in repressions against both left and right-wing groups, no matter how politicised they are. A lot of antifascists and right-wingers were put in jail on charges of possession of drugs, distribution of pornography (posts in social networks) and illegal business in addition to ordinary street conflicts with each other. The new charge of participation in an unregistered organisation testifies to this, too.We call all of you having the possibility to offer financial support to do so. In this case we only support Vadim Boyko, since so far we didn’t get any information testifying that he is sharing openly partiotic, sexist or homophobic views, also he was trying his best not to cooperate with the law enforcement, unlike some other defendants including those mentioned above.","Yes","","ST-8","Belarus","","Boyko","Vadim Sergeyevich","Zhodino","222160","Minskaya obl.","","","ul.

"Veronza Bowers","http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/2GL3DVEXWSVC3","Feb 04, 1946","","","Personal BackgroundVeronza Bowers Jr. is a former Black Panther Party member framed for the murder of a U.S. Park Ranger.  He is being illegally held past his 30 year sentence, making him one of the longest-held political prisoners in U.S. history.Legal CaseVeronza was convicted in the murder of a U.S. Park Ranger on the word of two government informers, both of whom received reduced sentences for other crimes by the Federal prosecutor’s office.There were no eye-witnesses and no evidence independent of these informants to link him to the crime. At his trial, Veronza offered alibi testimony which was not credited by the jury. Nor was testimony of two relatives of the informants who insisted that they were lying. The informants had all charges against them in this case dropped and one was given $10,000 by the government according to the prosecutor’s post-sentencing report. Veronza has consistently proclaimed his innocence of the crime he never committed, even at the expense of having his appeals for parole denied, for which an admission of guilt and contrition is virtually required, he insists on maintaining his innocence.Despite letters of support from prominent attorneys, former high-ranking representatives of regional commissions, prison officials and a member of the U.S. Congress, Veronza has continually been denied release due to intervention by the U.S. Parole Commission. A recent decision by the regional federal parole commission to grant his release was overturned by the National Commission. With the truth coming out daily about the high incidence of inmates who have been falsely convicted and imprisoned, exonerations of Death Row prisoners (156 to date), police and prosecutorial malfeasance and other failures of the criminal justice system, Veronza’s case deserves careful review.Life in PrisonDeeply committed to a spiritual faith and practice, Veronza founded and led the All-Faith Meditation Group. An interest in healing motivated him to study the ancient healing arts and philosophy of China and Japan. He has helped inmates both physically and spiritually overcome obstacles to their health and personal development. Mr. Bowers has also been honored by the Native American community as an honorary elder for his support and teaching of their spiritual and cultural practices.On a daily basis, he has worked with at-risk youth, inmates with anger-management problems and as a mentor and tutor for prisoners with learning disabilities. Numerous prison officials have relied on him as an intermediary in dealing with the most difficult inmates.

"Walter Bond (formerly adopted the name Abdul Haqq)","https://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/W7P09VVVUSYT/ref=cm_sw_su_w","Apr 16, 1976","","","Abdul is serving 12 years (until 03-21-2021) for the “ALF Lonewolf” arsons of the Sheepskin Factory in Colorado, the Tandy Leather Factory and the Tiburon Restaurant that sold foie gras in Utah. Abdul identifies as Hardline, which he describes as, “a belief system, and a way of life that lives by one ethic – that all innocent life is sacred, and must have the right to live out it’s natural state of existence in peace, without interference.” Hardline promotes a vegan, straight-edge lifestyle and has been criticized as anti-choice, homophobic, sex-negative and in opposition to LGBTQI equal rights. However, Abdul is openly bisexual and in a 2013 interview clarified that while he was once anti-choice, he now believes “no woman anywhere should feel ostracized or shamed for her decision to exercise her reproductive right.”Abdul is an imprisoned Animal Liberation Front activist who was arrested in the summer of 2010 for the “ALF Lone Wolf” arsons of a sheepskin factory in Denver, Colorado, a leather factory in Salt Lake City, Utah and the Tiburon restaurant in Sandy, Utah which sold the incredibly cruel product foie gras. He pled guilty to all three arsons as well as one count of AETA (the infamous Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act). Walter received a total prison sentence of 12 years and 3 months and is scheduled for release on April 14, 2021.As a young man Walter worked for a construction company that built slaughterhouses in the Midwestern United States. The horrors he witnessed firsthand in “pork production” led him to quit in disgust and propelled him into the cause and struggle of Animal Liberation and ethical Veganism. For over 15 years, he worked as an activist educating the public about the positive effects of Veganism as well as the plight of farmed Animals and also as a volunteer for various Animal Sanctuaries in the western United States.In addition to Walter’s struggle for Animal Liberation he is also vehemently Straight Edge and opposes drug culture in all its various forms. In the winter of 1997 Walter destroyed one of the largest meth operations in north Iowa, an act of vigilante justice that earned him 4 years in state prison and became the subject of the song and music video “To Ashes” by the band “Earth Crisis”. Walter is also the author of the book “Always Looking Forward” a collection of essays and interviews that he wrote while in county jails in Utah and Colorado for his underground resistance against Animal exploitation.From January 2012 to March 11, 2015, Walter was imprisoned in a Communications Management Unit (CMU) in the United States Penitentiary at Marion, Illinois. (CMU’s are specialized, secretive and restricted prison units set up originally to house Muslim Political Prisoners.)   While there, Walter took Shahada (the declaration of faith in Islam) on August 5th of 2014 and accepted the name “Abdul Haqq” which means “Servant of The Truth.”  In March 2015, the Bureau of Prisons granted his request for transfer to the general population at USP Marion.  On September 21,  2015, Abdul Haqq was transferred to FCI Greenville.Abdul Haqq (Walter) remains defiant in the face of adversity and has written numerous articles, essays, and interviews that have traversed the globe through the internet and have been published in a number of periodicals and books and have been translated into several different languages.","Yes","Illinois","FCI Greenville","United States","","Walter","Bond #37096-013","Greenville","62246","","","","P.O.
