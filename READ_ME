Unfortunately I have hired two researchers, which is all I'm budgeted for at the moment.
However the web site is gaining momentum, and you are certainly at the top of my list.
Thanks for your interest.

*****

OK sounds good. I can commit to paying you for a maximum of 20 hours ($100) per week if you'd like to give me your Western Union number and get started. Please keep in mind this a temporary gig (depending on my budget and how things go).

Its www.pp3.cloud 

You have to register of course. It will email you and then you can login and get started.

I'd like you to concentrate on African countries. You can see we have inserted a few POCs ("prisoners of conscience") for Nigeria, Ethiopia, Eritrea, Cameroon, DR Congo, Egypt, Mauritania, Namibia . But any POCs you can find in any country are useful. This link gives you an idea of which are the worst countries:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_freedom_indices

To find POCs, I've been googling with keywords like "dissident", "arrested", "detained" and the name of the country. But You have to use your ingenuity.

To insert, use the "Report Possible Political Prisoner" button on the navigation bar. You'll notice that only the POC's name and the description and link (URL of the web-site that mentions the POC) and status fields are required, but the more data the better.  Its pretty self-explanatory. The description has a max of 2500 chars. I usually just paste a few paragraphs about the arrest or trial. The Amnesty International and HRW fields are useful to track whether A.I. and/or Human Rights Watch have spoken out about this POC. 

Of course in almost all cases, the authorities in that country claim that every prisoner is a criminal and not a POC, and its usually impossible to know the truth. In general if somebody is alleged to have conspired to commit a violent act or to have conspired with a foreign government, A.I. doesn't recognize them as a POC. But if they were arrested for trying to organize a political party or merely for saying something offensive on Facebook, in many countries that's enough to get you arrested and you'd be considered a POC by A.I.

With countries like China and Iran with thousands of POCS, we obviously can't spend too much time on each prisoner. Other countries like Israel and North Korea are almost impossible to find data.

If you find a list of more than 10, I'd like you to attach the link in an email to me rather than enter manually, because I can batch-load 10+ faster than we could enter them manually. 

Also there's nothing (at the moment) to stop you from entering a duplicate, so you have to make sure a POC is not already in the database. I search the country page (command-F or control-F) before I enter a new POC. However you can attach any number of newslinks to any POC using the "ADD ARTICLE" button on the POC page if you find an article mentioning a POC who is already in the database. You won't be able to delete POCs, but you can email me if you need to delete anything. You'll notice every POC has a 5 or 6-digit number for easy reference.


Also I'd like you to upload any photos you can find. What I've been doing is googling the name for images. Sometimes you have to look for clues as to whether a photo is really the POC in question (and not a famous soccer player in Uruguay with the same name). I usually download the best photo I can find, and you have to name it exactly like the prisoner name, but with underscores in place of spaces e.g. you have to name the photo for Raif Badawi "Raif_Badawi.jpg" , then upload using the Upload Photo button on the navigation bar. Only one photo per POC. It should show up on the POC's page immediately if you spelled the .jpg correctly. Then of course you can delete it from your hard-drive.

I can can see in my log what you're doing, so I might email you with suggestions. The sooner you can start the better.

Work on the web-site is ongoing and I'll try to notify you if I'm expecting down-time, but sometimes it happens unexpectedly. You might run into some bugs and I'd appreciate your observations.

Thanks for your interest.

Hello -
I am working on http://www.pp3.cloud, which tracks political prisoners.
I wondered if you had a list of prisoners in spreadsheet or csv format or a CD I could purchase.

Thanks for your time.

This formula is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /usr/local,
because macOS provides the BSD gettext library & some software gets confused if both are in the library path.

If you need to have this software first in your PATH run:
  echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/gettext/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/gettext/lib

RE: online political prisoner database

Hello -

http://www.pp3.cloud is an online database of probable political prisoners. Anybody can register / log in and report a prisoner, upload photos of a prisoner, attach newslinks to a prisoner and blog. The blogs appear on the prisoner's and the country's page.

Recently we passed the 15,000 mark. 

Please have a look.
Thanks
Mike Sweeney

1) works on localhost!! (but writes to ~/epa7658577/epa7658477/media)
2) changed settings:
#EDIA_ROOT = os.path.join(PROJECT_DIR, 'media')
#EDIA_URL = os.path.join(PROJECT_DIR, 'media/')
MEDIA_ROOT = os.path.join('static')
MEDIA_URL = os.path.join('static/')
3) now it uploads to static
4) generate aws principal policy:

1) Make a list of top ranking sites in your niche, particularly those not in direct competition, and send them an email telling them about your cause.
2) Join sites like Digg and Reddit and submit your content. If people pick up on a story, and debate it, links will likely follow.

3) Issue press releases, using sites such as PRWeb. Optimize your press releases. Research your keywords, include them in the title tag, paragraph titles and the body copy of the release, link to the press release from your site, and use keywords in the link text.

4) Send a press release to a journalist keeping in mind that they are often willing to link to non-profit websites in the eventuating online version of the article.

branching in git:
1)
git checkout -b iss53
Switched to a new branch "iss53"
This is shorthand for:
$ git branch iss53
$ git checkout iss53

2) 
vim index.html (fix and test bug)
$ git commit -a -m 'added a new footer [issue 53]'

3) For now, let’s assume you’ve committed all your changes, so you can switch back to your master branch:
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch 'master'

4)
Next, you have a hotfix to make. Let’s create a hotfix branch on which to work until it’s completed:
$ git checkout -b hotfix
Switched to a new branch 'hotfix'
$ vim index.html
$ git commit -a -m 'fixed the broken email address'
[hotfix 1fb7853] fixed the broken email address
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+)

5)
$ git checkout master
$ git merge hotfix
6)
Now you can switch back to your work-in-progress branch on issue #53 and continue working on it.
$ git checkout iss53
Switched to branch "iss53"
$ vim index.html
$ git commit -a -m 'finished the new footer [issue 53]'
