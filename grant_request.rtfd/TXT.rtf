Anyone in the world can register on the site and immediately report a victim of unjust imprisonment and can provide information, upload photographs, blog, and attach newslinks, all of which appear immediately on the website.\'a0\
The design was inspired by and based on the book "Django Unleashed" and is hosted on heroku and managed on github.\'a0\

\cf2 I am using Google\'a0Analytics to analyze and increase traffic. It is possible to observe in which countries the website is being viewed and which keywords were "googled" to arrive at the the site on any given "hit". It is already the case that when one "googles" a prisoner name, the site often comes "to the top". Also I can view any changes to the database as they occur. I make backups daily and continue to work to improve the appearance of the site and the multi-lingual features e.g. the list of countries is in your preferred language.\'a0\
The goal is for the site to become self-sustaining and be used by tens of thousands of prisoners and their families daily. The intent is to accelerate the global trend toward increasing transparency and diminishing impunity by shedding light on the darkest side of the very worst countries. And of the course for the site to be blocked by the governments of any or all of those countries will be the real badge of honor.\
Thanks for your interest!\
