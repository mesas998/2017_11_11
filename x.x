At the demonstration, which called for an end to Egypt's restrictive "emergency laws," Human Rights Watch staff witnessed security officials beating and arresting the protesters, including two women.  The state of emergency, which allows the authorities to restrict basic rights, has been continuously in effect for 29 years.  "The Egyptian authorities respond with lawless brutality to protesters peacefully demanding restoration of their human rights," said Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. "Let today's beating and arrests of demonstrators remind countries that finance and arm the Egyptian government what their ally is really all about." The April 6 youth activist group organized this demonstration "to demand an end to 29 years of the state of emergency and amendments of Articles 76, 77 and 88 of the constitution," to allow for open and inclusive presidential elections. The security authorities had refused permission for the demonstration, using their powers under the emergency law, which bans all demonstrations.  Egypt has been governed under emergency law almost continuously since 1967, and without interruption since Hosni Mubarak became president in October 1981 after the assassination of president Anwar Sadat. The law gives the executive - in practice the Ministry of Interior - extensive powers to suspend basic rights such as prohibiting demonstrations, censoring newspapers, monitoring personal communications, and detaining people indefinitely without charge.  Because of massed security forces, the group of at least 70 protestors was unable to congregate today in Tahrir Square, the main square in central Cairo, as publicly announced.  Central security vans were parked prominently on several side streets, and the square was full of riot police and groups of plainclothes security at every street corner and by the subway exits.  a group of about 50 to 60 demonstrators managed to regroup in front of the Shura Council on Kasr Aini Street, where a Human Rights Watch researcher who was present throughout observed them peacefully chanting slogans.  They were surrounded by two rows of riot police wielding batons and dozens of plainclothes and uniformed security officials on both sides of the road.
