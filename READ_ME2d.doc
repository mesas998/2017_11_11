ts written in Django 1.9.7 (python 3.6.3) . The data is in PostgreSQL. The uploaded photos are stored in Cloudinary. PostgreSQL and Cloudinary are add-ons. So I' paying $125 / month for heroku, PostgreSQL and Cloudinary. 

I've got 2 half-time in researchers in India. I pay them $5 / hour via Western Union.

I've been experimenting with Google Adwords using recently entered prisoner names as keywords. It tells you how many times the name has been googled in the last week.

I can see in Google Analytics that we're starting to get traffic in the UK,  Ethiopia, France, Turkey Armenia, Brazil, Iran, Morocco, Netherlands, Philippines, Pakistans, Austria, Azerbaijan, Canada, Cameroon, Columbia, Germany, Egypt, Spain, Georgia, Indonesia, Italy, Mongolia, Nigeria, Peru, Slovenia, Senegal, Togo and Vietnam.

The newslink model in postgreSQL has a foreign key pointing to prisoner, which has a foreign key pointing to country. The blog key contains the year,month and a slugs. Blogs appear on both the prisoner and country detail page. 

The countries are shown in your language preference e.g. if you change you browser to Arabic, the countries appear in Arabic.

I have a few python scripts for things like batch loading (from a csv file) and tracking changes e.g. I can see what my researchers are doing in real time.

Here are useful aliases: 

alias b1='heroku pg:backups:capture --app immense-temple-86427'

alias b2='heroku pg:backups --app immense-temple-86427'

alias b3='heroku pg:backups:download'

alias dj='cd ~/suorganizer'

alias ej='diskutil unmountDisk force /Volumes/Lexar'

alias f='find . -print|more'

alias fd='cd ~/epa7658577'

alias hb='heroku run bash'

alias hp='heroku pg:psql'

alias ll='cd /Library/Python/3.4/site-packages/django'

alias lq='ls -lat|more'

alias mr='./manage.py runserver &'

alias ms='./manage.py shell'

alias pq='ps -ef |grep ython'

alias rr='perl -i -pe '\''s/\r//'\'' '

alias ss='cat  | sed -e '\''s/[\r\n]//g'\'' > '

alias ww='~/ww.sh $1'

I do develpment on a macbook and I use the vi editor and test on localhost i.e. http://127.0.0.1:8000.

The site is managed on github, so to when I'm ready to push changes to prod (heroku) I:

1) $ b1

2) $ b2

3) $ b3

4) $ git status

The files that have changed show in red

5) $ git add -A

Those files show in green, meaning they are staged (ready to commit)

6) $ git commit -m "a comment"

7) $ git push heroku master

Changes are then in effect e.g. a new field will show up on the prisoner detail pages

$ heroku run bash - that gets you to the heroku command line. Then do "./manage.py shell" to get into the python/Django shell on heroku.

The project root is epa7658577. There are two apps: nutr contains prisoners, country and newslink models and (mostly class-based) views. The other app is blog. The design is very similar to the book "Django Unleashed", so it uses mixins and url reversal and a base template in both apps that extend the project base template in epa7658577/templates which contains the navigation bar and footer. Also there is a validation tag in the base template that allows google to verify ownership.

So the files are organized like this:



                                     epa7658477 (project root)

epa7658577       templates                nutr app	                  blog app

        |                       |                               |                                    |

settings.py         base.htm                   models.py           models.py

urls.py                                                  views.py             views.py

                                                             urls.py                urls.py

Authentication is normal. They have to open an email after they register and set a password. The models have decorators to control authorization. There's only one superuser, and only I know the password. There is an admin, which can be used for controlling usernames/passwords.

Also under nutr and blog are template dirs containing nutr and blog dirs respectively, which both contain base.html and various templates e.g. poc_form.html for updating or creating prisoner objects.

The donations go into a separate (named pp3cloud) Wells Fargo accout via stripe.

Also I pay the researchers and web hosting out of that account. Its registered as a nonprofit in Colorado, and I am applying for 501(c)(3) .
