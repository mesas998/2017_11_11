1) create project in home dir:
cd
django-admin startproject mysite

this creates:
mysite/
    manage.py
    mysite/
        __init__.py
        settings.py
        urls.py
        wsgi.py


2) change to outside mysite and start server
cd
cd mysite
python manage.py runserver &

(how does it know about mysite/polls/url.py ? answer: it doesn't, polls doesn't exist yet)


3) create polls app

python manage.py startapp polls

4) add a view to polls/views.py:
from django.http import HttpResponse


def index(request):
    return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the polls index.")

5) create a polls/urls.py and create a urlpattern:
polls/urls.py
from django.conf.urls import url

from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^$', views.index, name='index'),
]

Now, the question is how is django going to know about this urls.py?
Go back to the outer mysite/urls.py. Point to admin and polls:

urlpatterns = [
    url(r'^polls/', include('polls.urls')),
    url(r'^admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
